description: Rigorous, reproducible template for decomposing an Open Design (nexu-io/open-design) apps/web god-component into the ADR-0002 machine-enforced vertical-slice architecture. Uses apps/web/src/features/memory (the MemorySection canary) as the canonical reference implementation. Splits a multi-thousand-line component into four homes — wire DTOs in packages/contracts, transport adapters (+ browser bridges) in apps/web/src/providers, and ports + pure rules + feature-local hooks + dumb components in apps/web/src/features/<slice> — bound by an injected dependencies.ts DI seam, enforced by the check-web-slice-boundaries guard, behavior-preserving, then validates and commits. Trigger words fixing-open-design-web, decompose a web god-component, apply the vertical-slice pattern, vertical-slice refactor, slice this component, frontend god-file refactor.

# fixing-open-design-web — vertical-slice refactor template

Decompose an `apps/web` god-component of `nexu-io/open-design` into the **ADR-0002 vertical-slice architecture**, using `apps/web/src/features/memory/` (the **MemorySection** canary) as the proven reference implementation, then validate and commit.

> **This is the FRONTEND skill.** The sibling `fixing-open-design` skill is backend/daemon capability-barrels only and self-scopes OUT of `apps/web` — do not use it here. Frontend god-files (`apps/web/src/components/*.tsx`) follow the vertical-slice pattern below, which is a *different* architecture (four homes + DI ports, not core/ + subdir barrels).

> **Agent-agnostic.** This is a plain `SKILL.md` — any agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, OpenCode) can follow it. It names *capabilities* ("track progress", "run this command"), never a tool API.

**The reference is the spec.** Everything this skill asks for already exists, done correctly, in the two canary slices:
- **Primary: `apps/web/src/features/memory/` + `apps/web/src/providers/memory/` + `apps/web/tests/features/memory/`** — the MemorySection decomposition. When an instruction here is ambiguous, open that slice and copy its shape exactly.
- Secondary: `apps/web/src/features/mcp-client/` + `apps/web/src/providers/mcp/` — the McpClientSection decomposition (includes OAuth browser-bridge examples).

Read `docs/adr/0002-frontend-vertical-slice-decomposition.md` (the WHY) and `apps/web/AGENTS.md` before you start. The guard you must pass is `scripts/check-web-slice-boundaries.ts`.

> ⚠️ As of this writing ADR 0002, the guard, and the canaries live on the `refactor/web-memory-slice` / `refactor/web-mcp-client-slice` branches, NOT on `main`. If they are absent from your checkout, base your branch off one of those, or fetch the ADR/guard/canary in first — do not reinvent the pattern.

---

## Required reference preflight (blocking)

Before editing, record these facts in the task handoff or PR draft. An agent that
cannot supply one must stop and report the missing reference; it must not
substitute a similar-looking local file or infer the pattern from memory.

1. The exact target component, source branch, and source commit SHA.
2. The primary canary was read in full: `apps/web/src/features/memory/`,
   `apps/web/src/providers/memory/`, and `apps/web/tests/features/memory/`.
3. `docs/adr/0002-frontend-vertical-slice-decomposition.md`, `apps/AGENTS.md`,
   and `scripts/check-web-slice-boundaries.ts` were read from the same branch as
   the canary.
4. Every current caller/importer of the target was enumerated and its public
   props, imperative handle, and event contract recorded.
5. A green baseline (the target's existing tests, web typecheck, and boundary
   guard) was captured before the first edit.

For an extraction into another repository rather than an in-place OD refactor,
also record the destination package and the explicit product seam that remains
in OD. The MemorySection structure still governs the split; only OD transport,
submission, and product-domain bindings may cross that seam through a port.

If the destination repository is Jini specifically: first read
`docs/jini-port/god-components-extraction-plan.md`'s "Consolidation map"
section in that repository and quote the exact row covering the target
component before choosing a destination package name. Several patterns in
this sweep recur across more than one god-component (the same "URL/OAuth
source config" shape shows up in at least 6 places, for example) — that map
exists specifically so each one lands in a shared destination instead of a
new near-duplicate every time. If the target isn't in that map, or its row is
marked "blocked" or "not yet actionable," stop and report the gap rather than
inventing a destination. Also apply Jini's React-layout policy (same doc,
"React-layout policy" note): within the destination feature folder, anything
importing React (`hooks/`, `components/`) goes under a `react/` subfolder;
everything else (`types.ts`/`rules.ts`/`ports.ts`/`dependencies.ts`) stays at
the feature's top level.

### Retained-behavior manifest (blocking)

Before moving code, inventory every generic behavior that remains in scope.
For each, record source line(s), invariant, destination module or host port,
and the test that proves it. Mark product-bound behavior `host-owned` with its
seam; never silently omit it. For interactive components explicitly inventory
keyboard shortcuts, pointer/cancel paths, history rules, resize/observer and
transform behavior, accessibility labels, and responsive placement. Completion
requires a passing test or a documented, user-approved scope change per row.

## The architecture in one screen — the four homes

1. **Wire DTOs + SSE event unions → `packages/contracts/src/api/<resource>.ts`.** Never redeclared in a slice; the daemon is a second consumer, so a slice-local copy would drift. Most resources already have a contract file — reuse it.
2. **Transport adapters (`fetch`/SSE/OAuth browser bridges) → `apps/web/src/providers/`.** Single-adapter resource = a flat `providers/<resource>.ts`; multi-adapter resource = a folder `providers/<resource>/` with one `index.ts` barrel. **Any browser subscription (`window`/`EventSource`/`BroadcastChannel`/timers) becomes a provider BRIDGE** (see `providers/memory/connector-auth.ts` and `providers/mcp/oauth-bridge.ts`) exposing `subscribeX(onEvent): () => void`, so the slice stays DOM-free.
3. **Ports + pure rules + UI types + hooks + dumb components → `apps/web/src/features/<slice>/`.** The slice owns its **port** (`ports.ts`) and reaches transport ONLY through `dependencies.ts` (the one file allowed to import `providers/`). Feature files depend on the port, never the adapter; slices never import each other's internals.
4. **Tests → `apps/web/tests/features/<slice>/`** (source stays source-only, per `AGENTS.md`).

Barrels mark boundaries, not folders: an `index.ts` at the slice root (public API), at a multi-adapter `providers/<resource>/`, and at a sub-slice boundary. `hooks/` and `components/` get NO barrel — direct relative imports.

Hooks are **feature-local and component-specific — no shared/app-level hook layer.** Each is `useX(port)` + a `useWiredX()` wirer that binds the real provider port. Duplication across slices is welcome; share only what *correctness* forces (DTOs, adapters). Components are **dumb/presentational** — props in, JSX out; small local disclosure state (`expanded`) is acceptable, but section/business state belongs in a hook. The slimmed **orchestrator** (the original `components/<Name>.tsx`) keeps only composition + any `forwardRef` handle + cross-cutting concerns (analytics), importing the slice through its **barrel only**.

---

## Guardrails (read before touching code)

1. **Behavior-preserving.** Preserve exact JSX markup, `className` strings, and i18n keys. Do NOT migrate CSS (that is a separate isolated PR). Do NOT change fetch semantics or public props.
2. **No logic changes in the same PR.** This is a structural move. Spotted a bug or a tempting cleanup? Note it for a follow-up; do not fold it in.
3. **Orchestrator public surface stays identical.** External importers (e.g. `SettingsDialog`, `IntegrationsView`) must not notice. Same exported names, same props, same handle.
4. **No new server-state cache library** (TanStack Query / SWR). Existing hand-rolled caching stays; ride cross-cutting caches in a context/dependency.
5. **Checkpoint incrementally (Jini addition, decided 2026-07-17).** Commit and push after each logical unit of work (each cluster, each priority tier, each file), not just once at the end. A cloud session can die, time out, or run out of budget mid-task — if it hasn't pushed anything yet, that work is gone with no way to recover it. Report honestly what's done vs. pending either way, but push what exists as you go so partial progress survives even without a final report.
5. **The guard must pass.** A slice whose `pnpm guard` is red is incomplete — the boundaries would rot immediately.

Track the phases below as a task list so progress stays visible.

---

## The guard — what `check-web-slice-boundaries.ts` enforces

In any `features/**` file:
- **No transport/DOM globals:** `fetch`, `EventSource`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `window`, `document`. Move them behind a provider adapter/bridge reached via the port.
- **No `providers/` imports except in `dependencies.ts`.** ⚠️ This catches `import type` too — the check is AST-level, not type-aware. So a port's result types (e.g. an OAuth start-result) must be **DEFINED IN-SLICE** (in `types.ts`) and bound structurally in `dependencies.ts`, NOT imported from the provider. (See `features/mcp-client/types.ts` `McpOAuthStartResult`.)
- **No cross-slice deep imports.** A slice is reachable only through its public `index.ts` barrel — from other slices AND from outside `features/**` (the orchestrator included). Both relative and `@/*`-aliased deep imports are rejected.
Plus: one transport home per route (a route may live in only one `providers/<resource>/` folder).

---

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Confirm target and green baseline
1. Identify the god-component (`apps/web/src/components/<Name>.tsx`). Confirm with the user if unstated.
2. **Capture a green baseline before editing:** run the component's existing tests + `pnpm --filter @open-design/web typecheck` and record numbers. If red at baseline, stop and surface it. (First-time setup: `corepack enable && pnpm install`, then `pnpm --filter @open-design/contracts build` — a stale contracts dist breaks typecheck.)
3. `git status` — if the tree is dirty with unrelated work, plan to `git add <specific paths>` at commit time.

### Phase 1 — Profile and design the layout
1. Read the whole file. Inventory: every `useState`/`useEffect`, every subcomponent, every `forwardRef`/imperative handle, every endpoint it fetches, and every consumer that imports it (`grep -rn "<Name>" apps/web/src` — check BOTH quote styles; a single-quote grep misses double-quote imports).
2. Classify: is it **transport-heavy** (many endpoints → the payoff is a `providers/<resource>/` folder + hooks) or **state/UI-heavy** (many `useState`/subcomponents, ≤1 endpoint → the payoff is hooks + `rules.ts` + splitting subcomponents, NOT a big provider layer)? MemorySection is transport-heavy; McpClientSection mixes both; a composer is state/UI-heavy.
3. Sketch the slice tree (mirror the canary): `types.ts`, `constants.ts`, `rules.ts` (+ `formatters.ts` if needed), `ports.ts`, `dependencies.ts`, `hooks/*.hooks.ts`, `components/*.tsx`, `index.ts`; plus any `providers/<resource>/` additions.
4. **Produce the full cluster-by-cluster extraction plan before extracting anything.** For every remaining cluster, write down: the state/functions it owns, its coupling to other clusters, the proposed target file, the extraction shape, and a risk rating — then work the plan top to bottom. Do NOT plan one cluster, extract it, re-profile the file, plan the next cluster, repeat: that reactive loop re-reads the file and re-runs the full validation cycle after every single cluster, which burns tokens and wall-clock on repeated serial passes that a single upfront pass avoids. If a cluster's real shape differs from the plan once you're inside it, correct that cluster's plan entry — don't abandon the plan for the rest.
5. **Turn high-risk manifest rows into red tests before implementation.** A happy-path render or one callback test is not parity evidence for a retained interaction.
6. **Decide which clusters can run in parallel.** A cluster is parallelizable if it doesn't share state/functions with another cluster you're about to run alongside it. For each parallel cluster, cut one worktree-isolated subagent from the same base commit; brief it with the established pattern (the canary + the most recently landed cluster as reference), its target file, and an explicit instruction to FLAG — not fix — anything that reaches outside its assigned cluster. **This defers integration cost, it does not eliminate it**: expect real merge conflicts even between clusters whose diffs both look additive, and watch for one specific silent-failure shape — two clusters that each independently delete their own adjacent function from the same source region can produce a 3-way-merge conflict block where NEITHER side's deletion/replacement survives; a plain conflict-resolution pass won't catch this without understanding both clusters' intent, so re-grep for both clusters' expected new call sites after resolving, not just for the absence of conflict markers.

### Phase 2 — Contracts (usually a no-op)
Check `packages/contracts/src/api/<resource>.ts` for the wire DTOs. Reuse them; add only genuinely new wire shapes. Never redeclare a DTO in the slice.

### Phase 3 — Providers + bridges
Move each `fetch`/SSE call into `providers/<resource>/` (folder + `index.ts` for multi-adapter; flat file otherwise). Turn each browser subscription into a `subscribeX(onEvent): () => void` **bridge** guarded by `typeof window === 'undefined'`. Re-home consumers of any deleted transport module (e.g. an old `state/<x>.ts`) onto the new provider barrel.

### Phase 4 — Ports + dependencies (the DI seam)
Define `ports.ts` — one interface per cluster the slice needs from the outside. Define port result types IN-SLICE (`types.ts`), not imported from `providers/`. `dependencies.ts` (the ONLY feature file allowed to import `providers/`) binds real adapters to each port; bindings are structural, so the provider's own types need not match the port's nominal types.

### Phase 5 — Pure rules
Move all pure logic (validation, mapping, inference, grouping, formatting, dirty-signatures) into `rules.ts`/`formatters.ts`/`constants.ts`. No React, no transport, no DOM — these test with zero doubles.

### Phase 6 — Feature-local hooks
One `useX(port): XController` per cluster + a `useWiredX()` wirer. Hooks hold state + call the injected port + import pure `rules` directly. Move even ephemeral UI state (picker query, expanded) into a hook or a small leaf component. **INFINITE-LOOP GOTCHA:** if a hook calls `useT()` (i18n) and puts `t` in a `useEffect`/`useCallback` dep array, it infinite-loops in a *bare* render (no `<I18nProvider>` → `t` is a fresh fn each render → effect refires → setState → re-render). Hold `t` in a `useRef`, drop it from deps, run load effects once (`[port]` or `[]`).

**A hook should own its own deps-bag callbacks, not just its state.** When a cluster's `actions.ts` functions are too entangled to be pure (Phase 5) but the cluster still has ONE natural owning hook, that hook should take the cross-cluster pieces it needs (other clusters' state/setters, the shared editor/DOM primitives) as PARAMS and build the deps bag + `useCallback`-wrap the bound functions INTERNALLY, returning them from its controller — the orchestrator just destructures ready-to-use callbacks, exactly like `MemorySection.tsx`'s `useEntries({ fireFlash, hydrateConfig, openEditor, closeEditor })` takes other hooks' outputs as params instead of the orchestrator composing them. Only fall back to assembling the deps bag in the orchestrator (Phase 8) when the callback genuinely has no single owning cluster (e.g. `submit`, which touches nearly everything).
- **Ordering**: moving deps-bag assembly into a hook usually means the hook's call site has to move later in the render (it now needs other clusters' state/deps-bag objects as params, which may not exist yet at the hook's original call position). This is safe — just move the call, and move its accumulating-subscription-adjacent effects (if any) with it.
- **Watch for orphaned plain-object references left behind**: a plain `const someDeps = { ...; setXFromMovedHook, ... }` built earlier in the render (not deferred inside an effect/callback) will throw a real TDZ `ReferenceError` at runtime if it reads a value the relocated hook now returns later in the render. `tsc` will NOT catch this (types are structurally fine) — only a test that actually renders the component will. Grep every setter/value the moved hook returns for earlier plain-object usages before calling it done, and re-run the render-driving test suite, not just typecheck.

**Injectable hooks (do this once the slice is otherwise done).** Mirror `MemorySection.tsx`'s pattern: define an orchestrator-local `<Name>Hooks` interface listing each feature hook as an optional prop (`useX?: (params) => XController`), destructure it in the component signature with each prop defaulting to the real wired hook (`useModals = useComposerModals`), and change `forwardRef<Handle, Props>` to `forwardRef<Handle, Props & <Name>Hooks>` if the orchestrator uses a handle. This lets a test inject a fake hook and render the orchestrator directly instead of mocking modules. **GOTCHA**: the prop name must differ from the identifier it defaults to (`useComments = useCommentAttachments`, never `useCommentAttachments = useCommentAttachments`) — a destructuring parameter default that references its own binding name throws a TDZ error, because the new parameter-scope binding shadows the outer one from the start of the parameter list.

### Phase 7 — Dumb components
Split subcomponents into `components/*.tsx`: props in, JSX out. A component that internally needs a hook (e.g. a per-item OAuth control) splits into a wired wrapper + a presentational `*View` (see `McpOAuthControl` + `McpOAuthControlView`). Preserve exact markup/classNames/i18n keys.

### Phase 8 — Orchestrator
Slim the original `components/<Name>.tsx` to composition only: `useWiredX()` hooks, dumb components, `forwardRef`/handle, analytics. Import the slice through its `index.ts` barrel ONLY. Keep its public export surface identical; re-export any handle type the barrel now owns.

**End-state target: zero standalone `function`/named-`const`-arrow declarations in the orchestrator.** After every cluster has landed, the orchestrator's render body should contain only: `useWiredX()` hook calls, the accumulating-subscription `useEffect`s that must stay per the effect-placement rule, trivial derived-value `const`s/`useMemo`/`useCallback`, the `forwardRef` handle, and JSX. Before reaching for a local `useCallback`, check the escape hatches in order:
0. **Does this callback have one natural owning hook?** Move the deps-bag assembly + `useCallback` into that hook instead (Phase 6) — this is the default, not the exception. Only the genuinely cross-cutting callbacks (nothing owns them — `submit`, an event-listener payload handler) stay orchestrator-level.
1. **Is it pure** (no transport, no DOM, only reads primitives/arrays it's given)? Move it to `rules.ts` as a plain function even if it currently reads 5+ pieces of orchestrator state — bundle them into one params object.
2. **Is it DOM-only** (querySelector/focus/requestAnimationFrame, no business state)? Move it to `providers/dom.ts` (or a similar shared provider) as a plain SSR-guarded function; the orchestrator keeps a 1-line `useCallback` calling it.
3. **Does an effect's callback body contain real branching/business logic**? Extract the LOGIC into a deps-bag `actions.ts` function taking the event payload as an explicit arg — only the `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` registration itself has to stay in the orchestrator's effect.
4. Only after 0–3 are exhausted: wrap what's left in `useCallback`.

### Phase 8.5 — Audit, don't just grep for named functions
"Zero standalone functions" (Phase 8) is a **symptom check**, not the audit. A grep for `^\s*function \|^\s*const \w+ = (` at the top level has three blind spots:
1. **It never looks inside JSX.** An inline `onSomething={(x) => { ...real branching, multiple setter calls... }}` never matches a top-level grep. Enumerate every JSX prop assigned an inline arrow function with a body longer than ~3 lines or containing branching/multiple setter calls, and run each one through the same Phase 8 escalation order as a named function would get.
2. **"Wrapped in `useCallback`" is not the same as "audited."** Re-derive from scratch which escalation-order step it actually belongs to.
3. **Bare `useState`/`useRef` left in the orchestrator needs its own enumeration pass.**
4. **The zero-functions grep does not match `useMemo`/`useEffect` bodies either.** Enumerate every remaining `useMemo`/`useEffect` in the orchestrator by name and check its body.

Do this pass once, after Phase 8 looks done, before moving to Phase 9.

### Phase 9 — Tests
In `apps/web/tests/features/<slice>/`: pure `rules` tests (no doubles); hooks via `renderHook` + a hand-written fake port (wrap in `<I18nProvider initial="en">` if the hook uses `useT`); dumb components under `@testing-library/react`; provider adapters mock global `fetch`; add a `// @vitest-environment node` companion for any `typeof window === 'undefined'` SSR guard (genuine coverage, no source change). **Target ≥99% on all 4 metrics (statements/branches/functions/lines), aggregate AND per file, with 100% as the actual goal** (raised from the vendored original's ≥98% — see Phase 9.5 for the loop that gets you there honestly).

Walk the retained-behavior manifest row by row before declaring tests complete.
For a canvas/overlay/editor, mount and test pointer cancel, normalized
coordinates after resize/transform, every history rule, keyboard shortcuts,
and observer-driven repositioning; testing a pure helper alone is insufficient.
**Mounted/integration coverage is mandatory, not optional**: every hook needs a
`renderHook` test against a hand-written fake port, every component needs a
`@testing-library/react` mount test, and interactive behavior needs a test
that dispatches the real DOM event — a pure-logic unit test of the extracted
helper behind an interaction is not a substitute for exercising the
interaction itself.

### Phase 9.5 — Coverage-driven refactor loop (repeat until ≥99% on all 4 metrics, 100% is the goal)
Coverage is a floor, not a target to game. Run with `json-summary`+`json` reporters (the v8 text table drops rows) and read the real per-file numbers. While any of statements/branches/functions/lines sits below 99% (aggregate or per file) — and keep going toward 100% even after clearing 99%:
1. **Classify every uncovered line/branch before touching anything** — do not add a test or delete code speculatively:
   - **Genuinely reachable, just untested** → write the test. This is the common case and should be most of the loop's work.
   - **Dead branch** (a condition that can no longer occur, an `else` left over from a removed caller, a defensive check duplicated by an earlier guard) → **refactor it away** behaviorally-safely rather than write a contrived test to hit it. Deleting the branch is the fix, not padding the suite.
   - **SSR-only guard** (`typeof window === 'undefined'`) → add a `// @vitest-environment node` companion test that exercises the guard for real.
   - **TS-required fallback with no real runtime path** (a `??`/non-null assertion satisfying the type checker) → a non-null assertion with a one-line comment explaining why it's safe, not a test.
2. **Badly-wired code and endless nesting are refactor signals, not coverage problems.** If hitting a branch requires threading 4+ levels of conditional setup, or a function has grown enough responsibility that its branches multiply combinatorially, the fix is to flatten/extract — not to write an equally convoluted test that mirrors the nesting.
3. **Never fake the number. `/* v8 ignore */` (or any coverage-suppression comment) is NEVER a valid outcome of this loop, under any classification above, no exceptions.** If a branch truly cannot be justified by any of the four classifications, that's a signal the branch shouldn't exist — refactor it out. A dispatch violated this once before this bar was made explicit up front; it isn't a suggestion.
4. Re-run coverage after each batch of fixes; repeat from step 1 until every metric clears 99% aggregate and per file (and ideally 100%). Record the final numbers (aggregate + any file that needed a specific call-out) in the handoff/PR body.

### Phase 10 — Validate (nothing is done until green)
Run and record real numbers:
1. `pnpm --filter @open-design/web typecheck`
2. New slice tests: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run -c vitest.config.ts tests/features/<slice>` — **write output to a file and check the real exit code; do NOT pipe through `tail`** (the pipe returns tail's status and masks vitest's exit code). jsdom files are slow to transpile; allow several minutes.
3. Re-run the component's EXISTING tests unchanged — they must still pass (the behavior-preserving proof).
4. `pnpm guard` from the repo root — must print `apps/web vertical-slice boundary check passed.`

### Phase 11 — Commit / PR
1. Commit ONLY the refactor's files (`git add <paths>`). **No `Co-authored-by` trailer** (repo policy).
2. If opening a PR, cross-repo PRs push to the contributor's **fork** remote, not `origin` (upstream 403s). Body: **Why** (use case + the pain: unenforceable boundaries / testability), **What users will see** (nothing; internal refactor, public API identical; name the QA regression surface), **What this does**, **Surface area** (a pure refactor is `None` unless a new contract file was added), **Validation** (the real Phase 10 numbers).
3. For a very large target (SettingsDialog-class), a fully-validated PARTIAL (one section fully sliced + any leaked-helper consolidation) that keeps typecheck+guard+existing-tests green beats a broken whole — commit the rest as a clear `WIP:` commit. Never leave typecheck or guard red on the committed HEAD.
4. Verify delivery, not just local Git state: confirm the task branch exists on
the remote and that the draft PR URL resolves. If either is unavailable, commit
a task report with command output and the exact retry instruction; a hosted
task saying `READY` is not delivery evidence.

## Definition of done

- [ ] Green baseline captured before edits.
- [ ] Wire DTOs sourced from `packages/contracts` (not redeclared); transport in `providers/` (+ bridges for browser subscriptions).
- [ ] Slice owns `ports.ts` (result types in-slice) + `dependencies.ts` (the only provider importer); pure logic in `rules.ts`; feature-local `useX(port)` + `useWiredX()` hooks; dumb `components/`; one public `index.ts` barrel.
- [ ] Orchestrator slimmed, composes via the barrel only, public export surface identical (except for the optional injectable-hook props below, which are additive and don't change existing callers).
- [ ] Orchestrator has zero standalone `function`/named-`const`-arrow declarations left. Before landing here, check each remaining callback against Phase 8's escape-hatch order (owning hook → pure rule → DOM provider → deps-bag action → last-resort `useCallback`).
- [ ] Each feature hook call is injectable: an optional `<Name>Hooks` prop per hook, defaulting to the real wired hook (see Phase 8 "Injectable hooks").
- [ ] Exact markup / className / i18n keys preserved; no logic changes; no CSS migration; no TanStack/SWR.
- [ ] Retained-behavior manifest complete; every generic row has a passing
  targeted test or an explicit host-owned seam/scope decision.
- [ ] **Coverage ≥99% on all 4 metrics (statements/branches/functions/lines), aggregate and per file, 100% as the actual goal**, reached via the Phase 9.5 classify-then-fix loop (test the reachable, refactor away the dead/tangled, node-companion the SSR guards, non-null-assert the type-required fallbacks) — **never `/* v8 ignore */`, no exceptions.**
- [ ] Every hook has a mounted `renderHook` test against a fake port; every component has a `@testing-library/react` mount test; interactive behavior has a real-DOM-event test — pure-function tests alone don't satisfy this.
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @open-design/web typecheck`, new slice tests, existing component tests, and `pnpm guard` (vertical-slice boundary check) all green — numbers recorded.
- [ ] Committed with no co-author trailer; PR (if any) pushed to the fork with the full body.
- [ ] Remote branch and draft PR URL verified after hosted execution.
