# Jini — Proposed Structure (debate subject, v1)

Grounded in read-only recon of open-design (OD), open-design-agentic, and the four consumers. This is the CURRENT PROPOSAL to be adversarially critiqued — not settled.

## Goal (binding)

Jini = a general-purpose reusable engine for MANY products, with NO Open Design tilt. OD is one consumer. Confirmed consumers: **Open Design** (design tool), **Open-Marketing** (OD-for-marketing; a full engine fork), **Zana** (bolt/lovable/replit-on-desktop; independent, re-derived the arch with zero @open-design imports), **Tovu-Runner** (desktop operator host; reuses engine, swaps only apps/web/src). Frontend must move to **Vite** (not Next; less memory). Chat UI = **refactored ChatPane/ChatComposer**, NOT CopilotKit (AG-UI only as an interop protocol via the existing agui-adapter).

## Harvest source

Primary source = **open-design-agentic** (most advanced trunk): already has Vite server option, ChatPane+ChatComposer decomposed into `features/chat-pane`+`features/chat-composer`, providers/dom split, agent-tools/browser-actions, plus the AI-Dev-Shop + ADS-memory automation harness. Fall back to OD main only where agentic lacks something.

## Repo strategy

Fresh empty `git init` (NOT gut-down of the 1.6GB OD copy). Preserve valuable branches via `git bundle` first. Populate package-by-package in dependency order with `git filter-repo`/`format-patch` to preserve authorship. Apache-2.0 + NOTICE crediting nexu-io/open-design. OD referenced for ongoing sync via a sibling blobless mirror (`--filter=blob:none`), never submodule/in-tree. Per-package `source-map.md` watermark + `scripts/sync-upstream.ts`.

## Key architecture decisions

1. **Ports/adapters daemon.** `createDaemon({ports})` factory; OD product routes register via a `routeModules` opt-in array from integrations/open-design. `PortsCoverRoutes<>` compile-time check.
2. **Engine needs ports OD lacks** (code-exec/live-preview, terminal/PTY, capability-registry) so it isn't OD-shaped — driven by Zana/Tovu/OM.
3. **Boundary lint from commit 1** (R1 engine isolation, R3 protocol purity downward-only, R5 product-neutrality string scan — harvest Open-Marketing's existing `product-neutrality.test.ts`).
4. **Frontend = hybrid**: engine ships headless packages; each product is a Vite feature-sliced app implementing slots. Frontend restructuring (App shell, providers, state, router, all features) is a MAJOR workstream, not just ChatPane/Composer.
5. **Automation adopted, not invented**: AI-Dev-Shop + ADS-memory come from open-design-agentic; project-runner is the thin durable execution/lease runtime on top.
6. **Extraction = strangler**: OD stays green until the final adapter-wiring flip; every task carries characterization tests + mock-replay parity.

## Dependency-ordered extraction (high level)

protocol → agent-runtime ∥ persistence → daemon-core → generic routes → OD adapter wiring; in parallel: platform/sidecar/components leaves → desktop-host; chat-core → chat-react/artifacts-react → workspace-react → reference-web/minimal-host. Automation layer (AI-Dev-Shop/ADS-memory adopt + project-runner build) can proceed independently.

## Known open questions

- Is `workspace-react` (reusable app-shell) engine, or should the shell stay per-product?
- Are code-exec/terminal/capability-registry v1, or parked until a consumer needs them?
- ~19 engine packages — too granular? Should some merge?
- Does the automation/ layer belong IN the Jini repo, or as a separate repo consumed by it?
- Monorepo-per-product vs each consumer in its own repo consuming published @jini/*.
