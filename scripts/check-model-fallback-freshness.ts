/**
 * R13 — model-fallback freshness.
 *
 * Some runtime defs ship a hand-written `fallbackModels` array that IS the list a picker renders
 * whenever nothing live answers. `claude` is the clearest case: the CLI has no list-models
 * subcommand, so on an ordinary install (no `~/.config/mms/model-routes.json`, no
 * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) the array in `defs/claude.ts` is the entire model picker.
 *
 * A hand-written list of vendor model ids is stale the day a model ships, and — before this check —
 * *nothing failed when it went stale*. That is the whole bug class: the list drifted from reality
 * for months, no test went red, no gate complained, and it took a human noticing "it doesn't say
 * Fable" to find it. Refreshing the array fixes today's data; this check is what makes the next
 * drift an event instead of a silent decay.
 *
 * ## The three rules
 *
 * **MF1 — a guarded def must declare when its list was last checked against reality.**
 * `RuntimeAgentDef.fallbackModelsAssertedAt` (`YYYY-MM-DD`). A guarded def missing the field, or
 * carrying an unparseable or future date, is a violation. This is what makes deleting the marker
 * fail rather than quietly disable the check.
 *
 * **MF2 — that assertion must not be older than {@link DEFAULT_MAX_AGE_DAYS}.**
 * Needs no credential and no network. It is the backstop that guarantees MF3 actually gets run
 * periodically, because MF3 can only speak when a live source happens to be reachable.
 *
 * **MF3 — when a live source IS reachable, the fallback must not be missing anything it reports.**
 * The direction matters: extra entries in the fallback are fine and deliberate (a superseded model
 * an operator may still be pinned to), a MISSING entry is the defect. Both live sources are
 * credential-free and machine-local:
 *
 *   - `codex` — `codex debug models`, the same probe the def itself uses, parsed by the def's own
 *     `parseCodexDebugModels` so the guard and the runtime can never disagree about what "visible"
 *     means.
 *   - `claude` — `~/.claude.json`'s `additionalModelOptionsCache`, the server-fetched list Claude
 *     Code's own `/model` picker renders. This is the source that already knew about Fable while
 *     the def did not, so it is precisely the signal that was missing.
 *
 * ## What it does with no credential, and what it does in CI
 *
 * Nothing here needs an API key. MF3's two sources need a locally installed CLI, not a credential.
 * When a source is unavailable — no `codex` on PATH, no `~/.claude.json`, an unreadable or empty
 * cache — MF3 **skips that def and says so on stdout, naming the def and the reason**. It never
 * passes silently, and it never fails for the absence of a tool. A machine with neither CLI runs
 * MF1 and MF2 only, which is the correct amount of signal for a machine that cannot observe
 * reality.
 *
 * The one way this check goes red without anybody changing code is MF2, on a calendar. That is
 * deliberate and it is the only credential-free way to detect "nobody has compared this list to
 * reality in four months". The remedy is one command and one line: re-run `pnpm guard` on a machine
 * with the CLIs installed, then bump `fallbackModelsAssertedAt`.
 *
 * ## Why it imports the real def instead of scanning its text
 *
 * The array that renders is the thing that must be checked, not a regex's guess at it. The def is
 * loaded at runtime through tsx's loader with a specifier built at runtime, so `tsc` never follows
 * it into `scripts/tsconfig.json`. A shape that no longer matches is reported as a violation rather
 * than silently yielding an empty list — the failure mode a text scan would have had.
