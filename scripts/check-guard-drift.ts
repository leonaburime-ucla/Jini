/**
 * @module check-guard-drift
 *
 * CI-facing ratchet over `guard.ts`'s own checks (`pnpm guard:drift`, run via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
 * `pnpm guard` itself is strict: any violation fails it, which is the right behavior for a developer
 * running it locally against a codebase they expect to be clean. But CI adoption started 2026-08-16
 * with 25 pre-existing violations already accumulated (see `scripts/guard-baseline.json`'s own
 * `_comment` for the full reasoning) — wiring `pnpm guard` straight into CI on day one would have
 * shipped a gate that is red from its first run, which the audit that triggered this specifically
 * warned gets ignored or disabled within days.
 *
 * This script runs the exact same checks `guard.ts` does, then diffs the result against the
 * checked-in baseline as a MULTISET, not a set: `packages/chat/.../types.ts` genuinely has two
 * separate `R2-deep-path` violations today (two different import statements), and a naive
 * presence-only diff would treat a third one appearing later as "already known" just because the
 * key existed once. `newViolationCount` for any (rule, file, reason) key is
 * `max(0, currentCount - baselineCount)` — exactly the count beyond what the baseline already
 * allows for that exact key, both directions (new violations reported as failures; baseline entries
 * no longer reproducing reported, not failed, as a nudge to delete them and let the baseline shrink).
 *
 * Deliberately reuses `runGuardSelfTest` unconditionally ahead of the diff, exactly like `guard.ts`'s
 * own `main()`, and never lets a baseline exempt a self-test failure: a check silently regressing to
 * a no-op is precisely the failure mode `guard.ts`'s header describes as a real past incident (it
 * printed "ok" unconditionally for weeks — see that file's STATUS note), and a violation-count
 * ratchet cannot catch it on its own, since a check that stops finding anything looks identical to
 * "the debt got fixed."
