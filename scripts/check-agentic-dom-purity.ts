/**
 * R9: `@jini-ai/agentic`'s DOM-free guarantee is compile-time, not conventional — see
 * `packages/agentic/source-map.md`'s "The DOM split". `packages/agentic/tsconfig.json` (the root
 * entry, `.`) excludes `src/dom` and resolves to a DOM-free `lib`; only
 * `packages/agentic/tsconfig.dom.json` (the `./dom` entry) resolves a DOM `lib`, and it is scoped
 * to `src/dom/**` only. Given that, a `document`/`window` reference anywhere outside `src/dom/**`
 * already fails `tsc -p tsconfig.json` with TS2584 — manually verified for this extraction:
 * `tsc --noEmit --strict --lib ES2023 <file with 'document.title'>` exits 2 with
 * `error TS2584: Cannot find name 'document'...`, while the same file compiles clean under
 * `--lib ES2023,DOM,DOM.Iterable`. That per-file guarantee is real and the compiler already
 * enforces it better than any regex this repo could write — so this check does not scan source.
 *
 * What is NOT protected is the CONFIGURATION that produces that guarantee. If `tsconfig.json`'s
 * `exclude` is ever narrowed to stop excluding `src/dom`, or a DOM lib quietly leaks into the root
 * config, or `tsconfig.dom.json`'s `include` widens beyond `src/dom` (so it starts compiling
 * universal code with a DOM lib in scope), the guarantee evaporates silently — no source file
 * changed, so no source-level scan would ever flag it. This check reads the two real config files
 * (resolving one level of `extends`, matching this repo's `tsconfig.base.json -> package
 * tsconfig.json` shape) and asserts:
 *   - the root config's `exclude` still contains an entry that resolves to `src/dom`;
 *   - the root config's effective `lib` still contains no DOM entry;
 *   - the DOM config's `include` still resolves to `src/dom` (or a path nested under it) only —
 *     never `src` or the package root;
 *   - the DOM config's effective `lib` still contains a DOM entry (if this regressed,
 *     `src/dom/dom-page-driver.ts` itself would fail to compile — `pnpm typecheck` already catches
 *     that, but stating it here documents why the split is coherent in both directions, not just
 *     the direction this check exists to protect).
 *
 * Deliberately config-only — no `tsc` subprocess in the steady-state check, matching
 * `check-engine-boundaries.ts`/`check-protocol-purity.ts`'s documented cost profile (fast,
 * deterministic, zero process spawn). `tsc`'s *behaviour* given a correct `lib`/`exclude` pair is
 * a property of the compiler, not of this codebase, and does not regress independent of the
 * configuration drift this check already catches — proven once by hand (see this file's own
 * module doc above) rather than re-spawning `tsc` on every `pnpm guard` run.
