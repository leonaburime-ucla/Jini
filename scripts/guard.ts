/**
 * Jini repo guard — aggregates the boundary + neutrality checks.
 * Run via `pnpm guard`. See foundry/docs/jini-port/extraction-plan.md §7 (guardrails) and §12 C-series.
 *
 * STATUS (2026-07-19 hardening pass): `checkEngineBoundaries` and `checkProtocolPurity` are
 * real (R1/R2/R3/R5/R6/R7 — see their own module docs), replacing the literal `return []`
 * stubs the 2026-07-19 swarm-consensus debate found (guard printed "ok" unconditionally for
 * weeks; see ADS-memory/reports/swarm-consensus/runs/2026-07-19T1632-consensus-report.md).
 * Two rules from the original TODO list are still genuinely unimplemented, not silently
 * dropped — see the bottom of this file.
 *
 * Fail-closed guarantee: before trusting either check against the real repo, `runGuardSelfTest`
 * runs both against known-bad fixtures and refuses to report "ok" on the real repo unless the
 * checks demonstrably still catch what they're supposed to. This is what makes "silently
 * regress to a no-op again" a self-test failure instead of a silent false "ok."
