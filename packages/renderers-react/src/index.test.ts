// from the package's public barrel (see packages/ui/src/index.test.ts for
// the precedent this mirrors).
//
// `html-utils.js` is deliberately NOT tracked here: its
// `injectAfterHeadOpen`/`injectBeforeHeadEnd`/`injectBeforeBodyEnd` share a
// name with (different, independently-built) functions from
// `srcdoc/index.js` that ARE tracked below, so a plain `exportName in
// barrel` check would pass even if `html-utils.js`'s own re-export (under
// its `*StringOnly` alias — see `index.ts`'s doc comment) were missing
// entirely. It gets its own explicit describe block instead.
