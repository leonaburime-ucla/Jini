/**
 * `EventLog` — the durable event-log kernel port (extraction-plan §12 C1).
 *
 * OD's own event durability is split across three tiers today: a ~2000-event
 * in-memory ring (`apps/daemon/src/runtimes/runs.ts` on the researched
 * `arch/server-startserver-endgame` branch), a durable copy written into the
 * product's own `messages.events_json` column, and a best-effort JSONL tail
 * file that nothing ever reads back for replay. Because the durable half
 * lives outside any port, a non-OD consumer that only wires the in-memory
 * ring silently loses in-flight output on a long-run reload. `EventLog` is
 * the fix: a single, storage-agnostic port that any adapter (this package's
 * in-memory reference implementation, or `@jini/sqlite`'s future durable
 * adapter — task 8) can satisfy. Every method returns a `Promise` even
 * though the in-memory implementation resolves synchronously, so a real
 * persistent adapter is a drop-in swap rather than an API break
 * (extraction-plan §2.6: "ports are async-only from day one").
