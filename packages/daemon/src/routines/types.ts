 * PROP-http-route-packs-automation-routines-2026-07-21.md`) flagged as "not something to

 * `scheduleRoutineAt`'s timer callback risks introducing new races in exactly that logic for no
 * behavioral gain, since a real backing store can still satisfy this port synchronously (an
 * in-process cache kept warm by the separately-async {@link RoutineStore}) even when durable
 * writes underneath are async. Building that bridge is host-level integration wiring, not this
