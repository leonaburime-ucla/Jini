 * `RunByteJournal` — gap 1 of the run/chat orchestration swarm-consensus
 * Final Recommendation ("a durable, typed byte-journal... recording every
 * byte sent to/received from a child agent process. This is the
 * observability floor every later increment depends on." — see
 * `ADS-memory/reports/swarm-consensus/runs/20260722T023000Z-consensus-report.md`).
 *
 * Deliberately backed by the existing `EventLog` port rather than a new
 * storage mechanism ("no new package" — same debate), but deliberately NOT
 * the same `EventLog` *instance* `RunLifecycle` appends its own
 * `RunProtocolEvent`s to: that log's `stream()` replays every entry it holds
 * to SSE subscribers, typed as `RunProtocolEvent`, and a `'journal'` entry
 * has no corresponding `RunProtocolEvent` kind. Reusing the same instance
 * would either leak raw, potentially untrusted agent bytes into the public
 * run-event stream or force widening `RunProtocolEvent` itself. A caller
 * supplies its own `EventLog` instance here — reusing the exact same port
 * type and, for a durable deployment, the exact same `@jini/sqlite` adapter
 * — so the journal gets the identical durability/replay guarantees without
 * touching the run-protocol vocabulary at all.
