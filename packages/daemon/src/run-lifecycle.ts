   *   the end append *throws*, the watchdog stays armed but the run also stays non-terminal.)
   * - `!record`: the only `runs.delete()` is `start()`'s unwind on a failed durable start append,
   *   which happens strictly before the watchdog is armed a few lines later. It is also required
   *   for type-narrowing `record` before `record.status.state` is read, so it cannot simply be
   *   dropped.
   *
   * Note the "start/finish race" test below does *not* exercise this guard despite its name: by the
   * time it advances the timers, `finish()` has already cancelled the watchdog, so the callback
   * never runs at all. It still correctly asserts that no second `finish()` happens.
