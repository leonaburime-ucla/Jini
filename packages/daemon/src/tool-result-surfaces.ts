/**
 * Splits a tool handler's return value into the part the MODEL may see and the parts only a HUMAN
 * may see.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * MCP's own model is that a tool result carries content blocks and the *host* decides which blocks
 * reach the model and which are rendered for the person. Keeping them in one payload is the
 * protocol; separating them is the host's job. Jini's daemon is the only actor standing in that
 * position — the spawned coding-agent CLI is not an MCP-UI host, and `okResult()`
 * (`@jini-ai/mcp`'s `tool-protocol.ts`) `JSON.stringify`s whatever it is handed into a single text
 * block. So a UI resource left in a handler's return value becomes ordinary model-visible context.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. A host's `content_post_delete` tool returned
 * `{ content: [textBlock, uiResource] }` where the resource's inline `<script>` held a single-use
 * confirmation token, and the tool's own description told the model the token "is never shown to
 * you". The model could read it out of its own tool result and approve its own deletion. The split
 * this module performs is what makes that structurally impossible.
 *
 * ## Whitelist, not blacklist — the security boundary
 *
 * {@link splitToolResultSurfaces} does NOT look for known UI shapes and strip them. It keeps only
 * block types explicitly known to be model-safe (`text`) and routes **everything else** to the
 * human channel, including block types that did not exist when this was written.
 *
 * The direction of that default is the whole point. A blacklist fails OPEN: the first time the
 * MCP-UI spec adds a block type this file has never heard of, an unrecognised block sails through
 * into model context — exactly the leak being fixed, reintroduced silently. A whitelist fails
 * CLOSED: an unrecognised block is withheld from the model and rendered for the human, so the worst
 * case is a surface that renders oddly rather than a secret that escapes.
 *
 * **Do not "improve" this by enumerating UI types to remove.** If a new block type is genuinely
 * model-safe, add it to {@link MODEL_VISIBLE_BLOCK_TYPES} deliberately, with a reason.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately left alone
 *
 * A return value that is not an MCP content envelope (`{ content: [...] }`) passes through
 * untouched. The overwhelming majority of registered tools return plain JSON — a list of posts, an
 * id, a count — and are not making a model-vs-human distinction at all. Rewriting those would be a
 * behavioural change to every tool in the registry in service of a problem they do not have.
 */

/**
 * Block `type` values a tool result may show the model.
 *
 * `text` and `image`, deliberately so — see this module's header before adding to it. `image` was
 * added rather than left to the fail-closed default because it is genuinely model-safe in a way an
 * MCP-UI resource is not: `ImageContent` is MCP's own vision-input mechanism, defined exactly so a
 * tool result can put picture bytes in front of the model (`assistant_demo_image`'s whole reason to
 * exist, in a downstream consuming product, is proving that round trip). That is a different property from "renders a UI a
 * human clicks" — an image block carries no interactive surface and no host-side secret the way an
 * embedded confirmation dialog can, so withholding it here would not close a leak, it would just
 * break the feature. Anything else absent from this list is still treated as human-only.
