/**
 * `AgentExecutor` — the driver `RunLifecycle`'s own module doc names as the
 * missing piece: *"It does not spawn or signal a subprocess... A driver...
 * calls `emit()` for agent/stdout/stderr/error events, observes cancellation
 * via `onCancelRequested`, and calls `finish()` once it knows the real
 * outcome."* This module is that driver — it wires `@jini-ai/agent-runtime`'s
 * registry/launch-resolution/stream-parsers (previously a complete but
 * disconnected library, zero callers anywhere outside its own package) into
 * a real `node:child_process` spawn, feeding both `RunLifecycle.emit()` and
 * this package's own `@jini-ai/protocol` event envelope.
 *
 * ## v1 scope: all 24 registered agent defs
 *
 * `@jini-ai/agent-runtime`'s registry ships 24 built-in defs across four
 * `streamFormat` families. The JSON-stream-parser family — the four
 * `createXStreamHandler`-shaped parsers (`claude-stream-json`,
 * `json-event-stream`, `copilot-stream-json`, `qoder-stream-json`), covering
 * 9 defs (amp, codebuddy, claude, codex, cursor-agent, opencode, mimo,
 * copilot, qoder) — plus all 9 `acp-json-rpc` defs, plus the one `pi-rpc`
 * def (`pi`), are wired here. ACP and pi-rpc each own their own JSON-RPC
 * prompt-delivery protocol, so each takes its own lifecycle branch rather
 * than being treated as a stdout-tail parser; pi-rpc's events arrive through
 * the exact same `{type, ...}` vocabulary `translateAgentRuntimeEvent`
 * already handles for ACP/JSON-stream (confirmed by reading every
 * `mapPiRpcEvent` `send()` call site — no new translation code was needed),
 * so only the driver wiring (spawn → attach → cancel → finish) was new for it.
 *
 * All 5 `streamFormat: 'plain'` defs — grok-build, aider, deepseek, qwen,
 * antigravity — are also driven, per
 * `ADS-memory/reports/proposals/PROP-plain-format-agent-driving-2026-07-21.md`'s
 * recommended "Option B": no structured stream parser at all. By default
 * every raw `child.stdout` chunk is forwarded verbatim as a `text_delta`
 * `'agent'` event, live, as it arrives (see `wireChildLifecycle`'s
 * `streamFormat === 'plain'` branch). Prompt delivery across the 5 is not
 * uniform: qwen and antigravity already fit the pre-existing stdin-only
 * guard; grok-build stages the prompt to a temp file via
 * `preparePromptFileForAgent` (its path threaded into `buildArgs` through a
 * `RuntimeContext`, cleaned up after the child exits on every path,
 * including pre-spawn/spawn-failure ones); aider/deepseek carry the prompt
 * on argv and are guarded pre-spawn by `checkPromptArgvBudget` plus the two
 * Windows CreateProcess command-line-expansion guards
 * (`checkWindowsCmdShimCommandLineBudget`/`checkWindowsDirectExeCommandLineBudget`).
 *
 * ## Antigravity's two extra needs, met declaratively
 *
 * Antigravity was the one def this driver rejected outright, for two reasons
 * the proposal doc (§2c) scoped out to a follow-up: `agy` can print an OAuth
 * sign-in URL to stdout and *still exit 0*, so live streaming leaks it; and
 * its model choice is written into one process-global `settings.json` that
 * `agy` reads on its own startup, so two concurrent runs race on it.
 *
 * Both are now met through **declarative `RuntimeAgentDef` fields this driver
 * reads generically** — `needsAgentLogFile`, `stdoutPolicy`, `runtimeLock` —
 * not a `def.id === 'antigravity'` branch. That mirrors how all 14 of the
 * def's other optional behavior flags (`promptViaFile`, `authProbe`,
 * `capturesSessionIdFromStream`, …) already work, and it is a deliberate
 * divergence from OD's own `server.ts`, which hardcodes `def.id ===
 * 'antigravity'` twice. The three fields are no-ops for the other 23 defs,
 * none of which declares any of them — so nothing else's behavior changed.
 *
 * `run()` still rejects cleanly (never a bare throw) with an
 * `AgentExecutorError` for any def whose `streamFormat` or prompt-delivery
 * shape this driver does not implement — see `isSupportedStreamFormat` and
 * `assessAgentExecutorCompatibility`.
 *
 * ## Invariant
 *
 * `RunLifecycle.start()` already transitions a run to `'running'` before
 * `run()` is ever called. Every *pre-spawn* failure path in `run()` — unknown
 * `agentId`, an unsupported `streamFormat`/prompt-delivery shape, an
 * unresolvable binary, or a spawn error — calls `lifecycle.finish({status:
 * 'failed', resumable: false, code: null, signal: null})` itself before
 * rejecting, so a run can never get stuck `'running'` with no watchdog.
 * `resumable` is unconditionally `false` on these paths — there is no spawned
 * child, hence nothing a classifier could examine (see
 * `FailureClassificationContext`'s own doc).
 *
 * For a run that *did* spawn and then failed, `resumable` is decided by
 * `classifyFailure` (gap 4 — see `ClassifyFailure`'s own doc), an injectable
 * port with no default of its own in this module (`undefined` stays
 * byte-identical to pre-gap-4 behavior — every `'failed'` outcome
 * resumable:false). OD's ~20-vendor-CLI text-matching failure classifier was
 * deliberately never ported (see `run/core/failure-taxonomy.ts`'s own doc and
 * `source-map.md`). The real zero-config classifier lives in `@jini-ai/daemon`'s
 * `run/core/retry.ts` (`resumableFromProcessExit`/`classifyProcessExitFailure`)
 * and is wired in by `@jini-ai/server`'s `createLocalNodeDaemon` — see that
 * package's own source-map.md, and `run/core/retry.ts`'s own doc for the
 * classification policy and its 2026-07-22 merge-time reconciliation against
 * a second, independently-built (and rejected) classifier that once lived in
 * this module.

 *      for its cwd, with nothing about cwd anywhere in the custom instructions file) — proof
 *      opencode's own defaults survive alongside a custom `instructions` entry, not just proof the

 *   3. Adding this key alongside `mcp` in the same `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` document disturbs
 *      neither: in one combined run, the MCP bridge still got its connection attempt (logged
 *      `key=jini type=local`) AND the custom instruction was still followed — same as running each
 *      key alone.
 *   4. `instructions` is re-read fresh from the env on every spawn, including a `-s <id>`-resumed
 *      turn (proved by swapping in a second instructions file between two turns of one resumed
 *      session and seeing the second turn immediately reflect it while still recalling

 * `config.toml`'s raw text, so {@link buildCodexHomeConfigToml} can append this run's own table
 * without producing the duplicate TOML key Codex's parser rejects at startup.
 *
 * Line-oriented, not a real TOML parser (matching {@link buildCodexMcpServerToml}'s own
 * no-TOML-dependency constraint), but wide enough to survive a hand-edited config, which is the
 * scenario this whole function exists for. A table header line is recognized when, after
 * trimming, it is `[<key>]` optionally followed only by a `# comment` (TOML's own grammar allows
 * nothing else there) — so it tolerates leading indentation, whitespace inside the brackets, a
 * trailing line comment, and a dotted key written with quoted segments (`["mcp_servers"."jini"]`),
 * via {@link splitTomlDottedKey}. Once such a header's key matches the jini table or one of its
 * subtables, every following line is dropped until the next table header (of any name) or EOF.
 * Every other table, key, comment-only, and blank line is passed through untouched.
 *
 * Deliberately unhandled, and why it is safe to leave that way:
 * - **Escape sequences inside quoted key segments** (e.g. a segment containing `\"`) — neither
 *   `mcp_servers` nor {@link JINI_MCP_SERVER_KEY} ever needs escaping, and this driver's own
 *   writer ({@link buildCodexMcpServerToml}) never emits a quoted form at all, so no real
 *   `config.toml` this driver produced can exercise this gap; a hand-edit that goes out of its
 *   way to escape a character inside a key that is supposed to spell "jini" would fail to match
 *   and fall back to today's pre-fix behavior (append a duplicate) rather than silently doing
 *   something worse.
 * - **`[[array-of-tables]]` syntax** — Codex's schema has no array-of-tables shape for
 *   `mcp_servers`, and the header regex's `[^[\]]+` capture cannot match a line starting with a
 *   second `[`, so `[[mcp_servers.jini]]` is not recognized as a header before or after this fix
 *   — unchanged, not a new gap.
 * - **A single quoted segment that happens to spell the same characters with the dot included**
 *   (e.g. `["mcp_servers.jini"]`, which in real TOML names one key literally containing a `.`,
 *   not two nested tables) — this collapses to the same joined string as the real nested-table
 *   spelling and is therefore treated as a match. This is a false positive in the conservative
 *   direction the reported bug calls for: a missed detection duplicates a key and crashes Codex,
 *   so on this axis over-matching a spelling nobody would plausibly hand-write for an MCP server
 *   table is preferable to under-matching the real one.
 * @param existingRaw - The real Codex home's `config.toml` content, already known to be defined
 * (callers pass `''` for a missing file).

 * **Login preservation, verified rather than assumed** (per this task's own instruction — "prove

 * than the operator's real one — including the real `HOME` with only `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` swapped —
 * and confirmed against Claude Code's own docs (code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication) why: "If
 * you've set the CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR environment variable, Claude Code keeps the .credentials.json
 * file under that directory instead, including the file the macOS fallback writes, and keys the
 * macOS Keychain entry to that directory too, so a session with a different CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR reads
 * a different entry." So a scratch directory is never logged in by default on ANY platform, not just
 * the ones with no Keychain at all. This function only closes the *portable* case: when the source
 * directory holds a file-based `.credentials.json` (Linux, Windows, or a Keychain-locked macOS
 * fallback — none of which this function can distinguish, and does not need to), it is copied
 * best-effort into the scratch directory, exactly `prepareCodexHomeForRun`'s `auth.json` copy. When
 * it does not (a normal macOS Keychain-only install, confirmed the common case on this codebase's
 * own dev machine), this function does NOT attempt to read the macOS Keychain itself — that would
 * mean this daemon process extracting a live OAuth secret out of an OS-managed credential store into
 * a plaintext file, a materially different and larger security surface than forwarding an
 * already-resolved credential the host handed it (which `credentialEnv`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` already
 * does, safely, today — see `AgentExecutorRunInput.credentialEnv`'s own doc). In that case this
 * mirrors `prepareCodexHomeForRun`'s own accepted outcome for a missing credential file verbatim:
 * "the spawned CLI runs unauthenticated" is documented, existing, precedented behavior in this file,
 * not a new failure mode invented here. A host that needs the isolated child to stay logged in on
 * such an install must supply a credential explicitly via `AgentExecutorRunInput.credentialEnv`
 * (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — both outrank Keychain-based subscription login
 * in Claude Code's own auth precedence, so the isolated child authenticates without ever needing the
 * operator's personal Keychain entry at all) — see this fix's own handoff report for the operational
 * consequence on a host with no such credential configured yet.
 *

 * oversight; see `packages/daemon/source-map.md`'s 2026-07-21 addition for
 * the reasoning.
 *
 * *When* those chunks leave is the def's call, via `def.stdoutPolicy`:
 *
 *   - `'live'` (the default, and every def but antigravity) — emit per
 *     chunk, as it arrives.
 *   - `'until-close'` — accumulate, and emit the whole thing exactly once
 *     from the `close` handler, after `def.stdoutPolicy.sanitize`. For an
 *     adapter that can print a secret to stdout and still exit 0, no
 *     per-chunk decision is safe: the pattern to redact can straddle two
 *     `'data'` events.
 *
 * The buffered path holds back the raw `'stdout'` echo too, not just the
 * `'agent'`/`text_delta`, and sanitizes both. Emitting an unsanitized raw
 * echo while withholding the chat copy would leak the exact string the
 * sanitizer exists to remove to any client subscribed to the run's events —

 * and must never also get `'prompt-path'`'s appended paths (see `resolveImageDeliveryAndArgvBudget`'s
 * call site in `run()` for that hazard). Handing them `prompt` would silently couple them to the
 * image rewrite; handing them `promptPrefix + input.prompt` applies exactly this resolver's overlay
 * decision to exactly the prompt text they were already sending.
 *
 * **The no-double-delivery invariant.** `promptPrefix` is a non-empty string on exactly one path —
 * the universal fallback, the only strategy that carries the overlay *in the prompt text*. Every
 * declared strategy (`'append-flag'`, `'env-var'`, `'config-instructions-file'`) and every
 * suppressed case (no overlay, continuing a session) returns `''`, so a def that receives the
 * overlay through argv, an env var, or a staged config file never also receives it inline. A

 * off the def's id" contract: a def earns overlay delivery by declaring a strategy, not by being
 * named in this file. That is what makes every def with no declaration work via the fallback
 * without any of their own files being touched.
 *
 * The fallback (no declared strategy — every def but `claude` today) prefixes the overlay directly
 * onto the composed prompt text, clearly delimited from the user's own request. It is gated on
 * session state, not merely on whether an overlay exists: a def that carries its own conversation
 * memory across spawns (`resumesSessionViaCli` / `resumesSessionViaAcpLoad`) persists whatever its
 * session-creating turn sends it — see `RuntimeContext.resumeSessionId`'s own doc: its presence on
 * a run means "continue a prior session", not "start one". Prefixing on every later turn of that
 * same session would therefore bake the overlay into the CLI's own stored history again and again,
 * compounding without bound turn over turn. So the fallback prefixes only when there is no resume
 * target yet (the session's own first turn, or a def with no session memory at all, which never
 * replays anything back at the CLI and so gets it on every turn).
 *
 * `'append-flag'` and `'env-var'` defs are the opposite case: the flag/env var is a fresh,
 * un-stored per-spawn directive — never part of what a resumed session replays — so it is set on
 * every turn unconditionally, exactly `claude`'s pre-existing (now-centralized) behavior before
 * this function existed.
 *
 * @param input.defId - Looks up this def's probed capabilities for an `'append-flag'` strategy's
 * `capabilityKey`. Otherwise unused — the dispatch itself is keyed off `systemPromptDelivery`, per
 * this function's own doc above, never off the id.
 * @param input.systemPromptDelivery - The def's declared strategy, or `undefined` for the fallback.
 * @param input.resumesSessionViaCli - The def's own flag (see `RuntimeAgentDef`'s doc).
 * @param input.resumesSessionViaAcpLoad - The def's own flag (see `RuntimeAgentDef`'s doc).
 * @param input.overlay - The computed `PromptAugmenter.systemOverlay()` result. `null`/`undefined`/
 * empty short-circuits to "no delivery" — byte-identical to no `PromptAugmenter` configured at all.
 * @param input.prompt - The composed prompt `buildArgs` would otherwise receive verbatim.
 * @param input.resumeSessionId - This run's `RuntimeContext.resumeSessionId`; presence means an
 * existing session is being continued, not created.
 * @returns A {@link SystemPromptOverlayDelivery}: the prefix this run's prompt text must carry
 * (`''` unless the fallback applies), that prefix already applied to `input.prompt`, any extra argv
 * to append to whatever `buildArgs` itself returns, and any env var overrides to merge into the
 * spawn env (`{}` for every strategy but `'env-var'`). Every one of `run()`'s four prompt
