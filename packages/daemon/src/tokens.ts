/**
 * `@jini/core` DI tokens for this package's kernel services, per
 * extraction-plan §2.2 ("Kernel exports only kernel-service tokens... every
 * other token lives in its owning feature package") — `RunLifecycle`,
 * `EventLog`, and `ToolExecutor` are themselves kernel nouns (§2.1), so
 * their tokens are defined here, alongside the services, rather than in
 * `@jini/core` itself. A pack composes against them the same way
 * `packages/core/src/index.test.ts` demonstrates for its own example tokens.
 *
 * `ArtifactStoreToken` used to live here too — moved to `@jini/artifacts`'s own
 * `tokens.ts` on 2026-07-19 (see that file's doc comment) after the swarm-consensus
 * architecture debate found it violated §2.1's "NO ... artifacts ... in the kernel" rule.
