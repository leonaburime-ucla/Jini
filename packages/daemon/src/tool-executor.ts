/**
 * `ToolExecutor` — the tool-execution boundary (extraction-plan.md §2.5 /
 * §8 task 6). This is **new design work, not a port**: OD only *observes*
 * `tool_use` (`apps/daemon/src/runtimes/tool-loop-guard.ts` watches for
 * runaway repetition; it never gates a call before it runs), so there is
 * no upstream source to lift here — see `source-map.md` for the fuller
 * account of why and where this diverges from every other file in this
 * repo.
 *
 * A tool is registered elsewhere (`@jini-ai/core`'s `ToolRegistry`, see
 * `tool-registry.ts` there) as `{descriptor, handler, policy}`. This
 * module is the *only* thing that can ever call `handler` — routes and
 * agents hold a `ToolRegistry` reference (descriptors only) and a
 * `ToolExecutor` reference (this file's public surface), never the
 * registration itself. `ToolExecutor.execute(principal, run, toolId,
 * input, signal)` is the sole invocation path.
 *
 * State machine (the audit trail extraction-plan.md §2.5 names verbatim):
 * `requested` → `authorized` (or `denied`, terminal) → `confirmed` (or
 * `confirmation-denied`, terminal; skipped entirely when the tool doesn't
 * require confirmation) → `started` → `completed` (or `failed` /
 * `timed-out` / `cancelled`, all terminal). Every transition is appended
 * to a per-execution, in-memory audit record retrievable via
 * `getAuditRecord`.
 *
 * `cancelled` is reachable from more places than the diagram above shows at
 * a glance: `execute()`'s optional `signal` (a transport disconnect, a run
 * cancellation, or `cancel(executionId)` itself) is observed for the whole
 * call, not only once a handler is running. Firing it while `authorized` is
 * still being decided, or while a confirmation is still pending, also ends
 * the call as `cancelled` — deliberately distinct from `confirmation-denied`,
 * which asserts a human actually answered. Nobody answered; the requester
 * left.
 *
 * Confirmation is resumable: when a tool requires confirmation and the
 * injected `ExecutionDelegate.onConfirm` doesn't supply a decision
 * synchronously (or via a settled Promise), `execute()`'s returned Promise
 * simply doesn't resolve yet — it's parked on an internal per-execution
 * deferred that only `resumeConfirmation(executionId, decision)` can
 * settle. A transport can call `resumeConfirmation` from a completely
 * separate request/tick (e.g. after a human clicks "Allow" in a UI raised
 * by `onConfirm`), arbitrarily long after `execute()` was first called.
 * "The headless kernel can't prompt" (extraction-plan.md §2.5) is exactly
 * this: `ToolExecutor` never renders anything — `ExecutionDelegate` is the
 * transport-supplied seam that does, and `resumeConfirmation` is how its
 * answer gets back in.
