/**
 * @module @jini-ai/mcp/bin/serve
 *
 * The bootable `jini-mcp` binary (`package.json`'s `"bin": { "jini-mcp": "./dist/bin/serve.js" }`)
 * — the real executable entry point gap 3's MCP-callback continuation-transport spike needed and
 * did not have (see `packages/daemon/source-map.md`'s "run/chat orchestration gap 3, part 1"
 * addition, and this package's own dated section in `source-map.md`). `../server/tool-server.js`'s
 * `createMcpToolServer` was always designed to run as *this process's own* stdio — meant to be a
 * script a client (Claude Code) spawns as its own child subprocess and talks to over that child's
 * stdin/stdout — but until this file, nothing in this package actually was that script.
 *
 * Follows `@jini-ai/cli/main.ts`'s established shape for a bootable, side-effect-guarded, `#!/usr/bin/env
 * node` entry point: a named, fully-dependency-injected `serve()` export (importable for tests, or
 * for a consumer building its own bin wrapper around it) plus a bottom-of-file guard that only
 * calls it for real when this module is the actual process entrypoint — mirrors that file's own
 * `isMainModule` check (Node's ESM equivalent of the CommonJS `require.main === module` idiom).
 * Deliberately **not** re-exported from `../index.ts`: that barrel is a plain library dependency, and
 * this file's whole purpose is a `process.env`-reading, stdio-serving, potentially `process.exit`-
 * calling side effect — bundling it into the library barrel would mean `import '@jini-ai/mcp'` could
 * start behaving like a spawned MCP server.
 *
 * **Scope: what this process is spawned to do.** One `jini-mcp` process serves exactly one run for
 * its entire lifetime — the spawning daemon injects {@link RUN_ID_ENV_VAR} into the child's own
 * environment before Claude Code (which in turn spawns *this* as its own MCP server child, per its
 * `.mcp.json`) ever starts talking to it. That is what lets `execute_delegated_tool`
 * (`../server/tools/delegated-tool.js`) close over a fixed `runId` at construction time instead of
 * trusting a model-supplied one — see that module's own doc for why that boundary matters. Every
 * other tool this server hosts (`RUN_TOOLS`, `../server/tools/run-tools.js`) is run-agnostic and
 * needed no such scoping.
 *
 * **Daemon-URL resolution** mirrors `@jini-ai/cli/main.ts`'s own posture: no baked-in default, just
 * `resolveDaemonUrl` (`@jini-ai/cli`) wired to a `--daemon-url`-shaped precedence chain — except this
 * process has no argv to parse (an MCP client launches it with a fixed `command`/`args`/`env`, not
 * interactive flags), so only the env-var step applies: {@link DAEMON_URL_ENV_VAR}. When unset,
 * `resolveDaemonUrl` throws, and this file's own top-level error boundary turns that into a clean
 * stderr message + non-zero exit rather than an unhandled rejection.
