/**
 * @module @jini-ai/mcp/server/tool-protocol
 *
 * The pure, SDK-connection-free half of the MCP tool-hosting mechanism: the
 * `McpToolDef` contract a caller registers tools against, `tools/list`
 * projection, and `tools/call` dispatch (look up a tool by name, run its
 * handler, wrap the result). None of this touches `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`'s
 * `Server`/transport classes or the network — a tool `handler` is just
 * `(args, ctx) => value | Promise<value>` that either returns a
 * JSON-serializable payload (wrapped as a successful MCP result) or throws
 * (wrapped as an `{isError:true}` MCP result). `./tool-server.js` is the thin
 * layer that wires this to a real `Server` + `StdioServerTransport`.
 *
 * ## The one exception to "wrapped as a successful MCP result"
 *
 * {@link okResult} used to JSON.stringify every non-string payload unconditionally, which is exactly
 * right for the overwhelming majority of handlers (plain JSON — an id, a list, a count) but wrong
 * for a handler whose payload IS already a well-formed MCP content envelope (`{content: [...]}` of
 * recognized block types). Stringifying that flattens a typed `image` block into an inert
 * base64-in-quotes string the client can no longer render or hand to a vision model — the exact bug
 * `execute_delegated_tool` (`../tools/delegated-tool.js`) hit: `@jini-ai/daemon`'s
 * `delegated-tool-bridge.ts` already keeps an image block in its returned `ToolExecutionResult.output`
 * (it is model-safe per that package's `tool-result-surfaces.ts`), but this module still turned it
 * back into text on the way out. It is also how a **human-confirmation token reached model-visible
 * text** in a separate, traced incident (`ADR-053` Decision 5): a `resource` block carrying the token
 * fell to the same stringify path because an earlier version of this fix only recognized `text` and
 * `image`, and `resource` was not yet in that hand-rolled allowlist.
 *
 * {@link okResult} now recognizes a `content` array whose every entry validates against the pinned
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`'s own `ContentBlockSchema` — the same union the SDK itself defines
 * `CallToolResultSchema.content` against — and passes such an envelope through verbatim instead of
 * stringifying it. Deferring to the SDK's schema rather than re-implementing a per-type shape check
 * here means every block type the pinned protocol version defines (`text`, `image`, `audio`,
 * `resource`, `resource_link` as of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@^1.29.0`) is recognized automatically,
 * and a future SDK upgrade that adds another block type is picked up the same way, without another
 * hand-edit to this module. Whitelist, not blacklist: a `content` array holding even one entry that
 * does not validate falls back to the stringify path, so a malformed block is never forwarded as if it
 * were valid protocol output. What this does **not** guarantee: a block type the pinned SDK does not
 * yet know about (a real future MCP protocol addition ahead of this dependency) still falls back to
 * stringify until the SDK dependency itself is upgraded — this fix converts "remember to update this
 * allowlist" into "remember to bump the SDK", not into an unconditional guarantee. It also does not
 * (and cannot) judge intent: a handler that puts a secret inside an otherwise well-formed `text` block
 * will still have it pass through as designed — withholding a value from the model is the handler's
 * responsibility (`ADR-053` Decision 4), not this generic wrapper's.
