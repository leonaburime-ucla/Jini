/**
 * @module @jini/mcp/server/resources/active-resource
 *
 * The one MCP *resource* this package ships: a read-only pointer to
 * `GET /api/active` (`packages/http/src/active-context.ts`'s `getActiveRoute`)
 * — the same underlying data `../tools/run-tools.js`'s `getActiveContextTool`
 * already proxies as a *tool*. This is not redundant: OD's origin
 * (`apps/daemon/src/mcp.ts`) exposed the identical `/api/active` payload
 * both ways — as the `get_active_context` tool (already ported, see
 * `../tools/run-tools.js`) AND as the `od://focus/active` resource (its
 * `ListResourcesRequestSchema`/`ReadResourceRequestSchema` handlers) —
 * because tools and resources serve different MCP client affordances: a
 * tool is invoked by the model mid-conversation, while a resource can be
 * listed and attached to context by the user/client without any tool call.
 * This module is that second affordance for the same primitive. See
 * `source-map.md`'s 2026-07-21 addition for why the rest of OD's resource
 * surface (`od://skills/...`, `od://design-systems/...`) was NOT ported the
 * same way (both require a Skill/DesignSystem noun this kernel doesn't have).
 *
 * Security posture matches every other tool/resource in this package: no
 * separate authorization mechanism here — whatever `@jini/http`'s
 * same-origin guard / bearer-auth middleware already enforces on
 * `GET /api/active` is the only gate a read of this resource passes
 * through.
