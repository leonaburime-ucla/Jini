/**
 * @module @jini/mcp/server/tools/delegated-tool
 *
 * `execute_delegated_tool` — the MCP-callback half of gap 3's continuation transport (see
 * `packages/daemon/source-map.md`'s "run/chat orchestration gap 3, part 1" addition and this
 * package's own dated section in `source-map.md` for the rest of the spike). The swarm-consensus
 * Final Recommendation asked for exactly this: "inject the already-shipped MCP host into one
 * MCP-capable CLI's launch config, prove a tool round-trip through the existing
 * `delegated-tool-bridge.ts`." Where `../tools/run-tools.js`'s tools proxy generic
 * run-lifecycle HTTP endpoints, this tool proxies the new `POST /api/delegated-tool-calls`
 * daemon route (`packages/http/src/delegated-tools.ts`), which is the one and only thing that
 * calls into `createDelegatedToolBridge` (`packages/daemon/src/delegated-tool-bridge.ts`) — the
 * same `ToolExecutor` deny-by-default gate every other tool-execution path in this codebase
 * already uses. No parallel authorization mechanism is introduced anywhere on this path.
 *
 * Unlike every other tool this package ships (`run-tools.ts`'s five tools, plain static
 * objects), this one is a **factory**. The MCP server subprocess a `claude` run spawns via
 * `.mcp.json` (see `../../bin/serve.js`) is scoped to exactly one `runId` for its entire
 * lifetime — the daemon injected that run id into the subprocess's own environment at spawn
 * time, before the model ever said a word. `runId` is therefore closed over at construction
 * time, not accepted as a per-call tool argument: a model has no legitimate way to pick, or
 * need to know, which run it is currently inside, and letting it supply one would open a
 * confused-deputy path (one run's MCP subprocess executing a tool call "as" a different run).
 * `toolUseId` is likewise generated per call (`randomUUID` by default), not model-supplied — a
 * model has no legitimate reason to choose its own correlation id either.
