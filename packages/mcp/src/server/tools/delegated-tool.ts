/**
 * @module @jini-ai/mcp/server/tools/delegated-tool
 *
 * `execute_delegated_tool` — the MCP-callback half of gap 3's continuation transport (see
 * `packages/daemon/source-map.md`'s "run/chat orchestration gap 3, part 1" addition and this
 * package's own dated section in `source-map.md` for the rest of the spike). The swarm-consensus
 * Final Recommendation asked for exactly this: "inject the already-shipped MCP host into one
 * MCP-capable CLI's launch config, prove a tool round-trip through the existing
 * `delegated-tool-bridge.ts`." Where `../tools/run-tools.js`'s tools proxy generic
 * run-lifecycle HTTP endpoints, this tool proxies the new `POST /api/delegated-tool-calls`
 * daemon route (`packages/http/src/delegated-tools.ts`), which is the one and only thing that
 * calls into `createDelegatedToolBridge` (`packages/daemon/src/delegated-tool-bridge.ts`) — the
 * same `ToolExecutor` deny-by-default gate every other tool-execution path in this codebase
 * already uses. No parallel authorization mechanism is introduced anywhere on this path.
 *
 * Unlike every other tool this package ships (`run-tools.ts`'s five tools, plain static
 * objects), this one is a **factory**. The MCP server subprocess a `claude` run spawns via
 * `.mcp.json` (see `../../bin/serve.js`) is scoped to exactly one `runId` for its entire
 * lifetime — the daemon injected that run id into the subprocess's own environment at spawn
 * time, before the model ever said a word. `runId` is therefore closed over at construction
 * time, not accepted as a per-call tool argument: a model has no legitimate way to pick, or
 * need to know, which run it is currently inside, and letting it supply one would open a
 * confused-deputy path (one run's MCP subprocess executing a tool call "as" a different run).
 * `toolUseId` is likewise generated per call (`randomUUID` by default), not model-supplied — a
 * model has no legitimate reason to choose its own correlation id either.

/**
 * Request deadline for one delegated tool call, overriding `daemon-client.ts`'s 15 s default.
 *
 * That default is sized for "a slow tool call" — a tool doing work. It is the wrong shape for this
 * route, which is the one path in the system where a registered handler may legitimately be waiting
 * on a *person*: a tool that raises an MCP-UI surface parks until the human answers it, and a human
 * reading a dialog does not answer in fifteen seconds. Left at the default, every human-in-the-loop
 * tool call fails at 15 s regardless of what the human eventually clicks.
 *
 * Six minutes is a *backstop*, not a budget. It assumes the host runs a tighter total-lifetime
 * ceiling on the exchange itself, which ends the call with an explicit "no answer" outcome first;
 * the extra headroom here just guarantees the exchange is always what gives up. Six minutes also
 * stays inside every measured agent-CLI ceiling (Claude Code 30 min idle, Gemini CLI 10 min),
 * which is what keeps this hop from becoming the binding constraint.
 *
 * A host whose exchange ceiling differs should override it via `delegatedToolTimeoutMs` rather
 * than have its number encoded here — the engine has no way to know a given host's exchange
 * policy, and hard-coding one host's value in generic engine source is what this default replaced.
 *
 * This is also, transitively, the hard cap on a multi-turn human conversation driven from one tool
 * call: however many turns an exchange takes, they all happen inside this one request. Raising that
 * ceiling starts here, not in the exchange store.
 *
 * The cost is real and accepted: a genuinely hung daemon now hangs this call for six minutes rather
 * than fifteen seconds. The daemon-side alternative does not exist to lean on — `ToolDescriptor.timeoutMs`
 * is unset on every registration today, so `ToolExecutor` arms no timer of its own.
