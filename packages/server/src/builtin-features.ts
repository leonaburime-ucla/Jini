/**
 * @module builtin-features
 *
 * Every route family this package can mount, expressed as a `JiniFeature` whose `compose` returns
 * one atomic `@jini-ai/core` `Pack`.
 *
 * The load-bearing property is that a family's **tools and its routes are the same pack**. Before
 * this module, `create-local-node-daemon.ts` registered the terminal tool and the three `daemon.db.*`
 * tools into a private registry in one place, and mounted `registerTerminalRoutes`/
 * `registerDaemonDbRoutes` in another — so gating only the route registrations would have left
 * `jini.terminal.create` registered and still reachable through the always-mounted
 * `POST /api/delegated-tool-calls`. Here, a feature that is not selected contributes neither, and
 * there is no second step to gate. `terminal: false` means the pty tool is *absent from the
 * registry*, so a delegated call naming it is an unregistered-tool error rather than a shell.
 *
 * Features borrow kernel infrastructure (`ctx.kernel`) and never own it — see `kernel-base.ts` for
 * why the sqlite connection in particular is shared rather than feature-owned.

 * ## What actually makes this inert, because an earlier version of this comment named the wrong
 * mechanism
 *
 * It previously claimed inertness came from "every registered tool's own deny-by-default
 * `ToolPolicy`". That is **false**, and believing it is dangerous. `@jini-ai/cms` registers every
 * one of its tools with a pass-through `policy: { authorize: () => 'allow' }` — deliberately, and
 * documented as such in `core/tools/registration-kit.ts`: each tool's permission is evaluated
 * exactly once, inside the domain function or via that file's `requireToolPermission`, so a second
 * evaluator in the policy would be the bug rather than the guard.
 *
 * What actually denies this principal is the identity layer being fail-closed on an UNKNOWN
 * subject: `identity/authorize.ts` starts with `principals.findById(...)` and returns
 * `{ allowed: false, reason: 'principal_disabled' }` when no row comes back. `anonymous-delegated`
 * has no row, so every permission-gated tool refuses it.
 *
 * ## The residual risk that follows from that, stated plainly
 *
 * The protection is the *tool's own* permission check, not this identity and not the registry. A
 * tool registered by some other host with a permissive `ToolPolicy` **and** no internal permission
 * check would execute for this principal. That is exactly why `@jini-ai/http-kit`'s
 * `DelegatedToolsHttpDeps.resolvePrincipal` documents itself as mandatory, and why the fallback
 * below warns rather than staying silent.
