/**
 * Shared redirect guard for `github-pages.ts`/`vercel.ts` — every `fetch()` call in both files
 * carries a live `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, and neither file previously passed a
 * `redirect` option, so a 3xx response from their hardcoded, trusted API origin
 * (`api.github.com`/`api.vercel.com`) would be followed transparently by `fetch()`, replaying that
 * Authorization header at whatever `Location` the response named. Under normal operation neither
 * origin redirects these endpoints, but a redirect is exactly the mechanism a compromised edge,
 * misconfigured origin, or MITM would use to exfiltrate the token to an attacker-controlled host —
 * flagged 2026-08-15 (a downstream product's deploy-publishing dispatch) and fixed here, in the adapter itself,
 * rather than only papering over it from a caller.
 *
 * `redirectGuardInit` is the one place every call site adds `redirect: 'manual'`.
 * `assertNotRedirected` is the one place that turns the resulting response into an honest, typed
 * failure. Per the WHATWG Fetch spec (undici implements this identically for Node, not just
 * browsers), `redirect: 'manual'` makes `fetch()` resolve to an "opaque-redirect filtered
 * response" for ANY 3xx — `status` 0, `type: 'opaqueredirect'`, no readable headers/body — so this
 * guard checks `type` first and `status` second (a `PROVIDER_ERROR`-shaped 3xx can never reach
 * this function with `status` in the 300s once `redirect: 'manual'` is set, but checking both
 * keeps this correct even if a future runtime implements manual mode differently).

 *   `fetch()`, before reading `resp.status`/`resp.json()` for any other reason — a caller that
 *   checks `resp.status === 404` (a real, expected branch in `getGitHubRefSha`) before this guard
 *   would never see that check misfire, since an opaque-redirect response's `status` is `0`, not
 *   `404` — but call ordering here still matters for every OTHER status-sensitive branch in
