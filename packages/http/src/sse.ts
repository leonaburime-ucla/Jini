/**
 * Generic Server-Sent-Events transport primitive.
 *
 * Before this file, the only SSE machinery in this package was inlined
 * directly inside `runs.ts`'s `registerRunEventStream` (a bounded-queue,
 * backpressure-aware `res.write`/`'drain'` state machine with Last-Event-ID
 * replay support) — see `source-map.md`'s 2026-07-19 "generic lifecycle SSE
 * projection" note and the many "requires SSE (deferred)" verdicts against
 * `chat.ts`/`memory.ts`/`terminal.ts` in the routes-classification table.
 * `createSseChannel` below is that same state machine, generalized over any
 * event type (not just `RunProtocolEvent`) so a route only has to describe
 * *what* to stream, not *how* to stream it. `runs.ts` is refactored to call
 * this primitive rather than keeping its own copy — the same discipline this
 * package already applies to `origin-validation.ts`/`compat.ts` (shared
 * mechanism, one implementation, one set of tests for the mechanism itself).
 *
 * OD's own precedent for a shared SSE primitive is `ctx.http.createSseResponse`
 * (an Express-request-scoped helper both `apps/daemon/src/routes/runs.ts` and
 * `apps/daemon/src/routes/terminal.ts` receive via dependency injection and
 * call themselves) — this file is the Jini equivalent of that role, not an
 * invented-from-scratch design.

 * fan-in, a PTY's `onData`, …) to {@link SseChannel.enqueue} and lets the
 * channel own delivery, ordering, and backpressure.
 *
 * The response's own `'close'` event (the client disconnecting) is observed
 * from construction time, before {@link SseChannel.open} is ever called —
 * this lets a caller `await` some asynchronous subscribe step (as `runs.ts`
 * does against `RunLifecycle.stream`) and still detect "the client already
 * disappeared while we were waiting" via {@link SseChannel.isClosed} once
 * that await resolves, without the disconnect handler itself trying to
 * re-end an already-gone response (see {@link SseChannel.end}'s doc for why
 * that distinction doesn't actually need special-casing).
 *
 * @param res - The response to stream over, typed against the raw `node:http` `ServerResponse`
 * rather than Express's own `Response` — Express's `Response` extends `ServerResponse` directly,
 * so every existing Express caller still satisfies this signature unchanged, and Fastify's
 * `reply.raw` is a real `ServerResponse` too, letting a Fastify caller use this same primitive
 * with no adapter shim. Never read from — only
 * `write`/`statusCode`/`setHeader`/`flushHeaders`/`end`/`on('close'|'drain')` are used, all of
 * which exist identically on the raw type (the one genuinely Express-specific call this function
 * used to make, `res.status(200)`, is `res.statusCode = 200` here instead — the same assignment
 * Express's own `.status()` performs internally).
 * @param options - See {@link CreateSseChannelOptions}.
 * @complexity `enqueue`/`open`/`end` are O(1) amortized; a full queue drain is O(events written).
