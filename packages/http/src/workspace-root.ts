/**
 * Generic, host-injectable "workspace root" resolution port.
 *
 * Several OD route packs need the same thing at the boundary: "given some
 * opaque resource reference, what filesystem directory does a spawned
 * process or launched editor run in?" OD answers that with
 * `ctx.projectStore.getProject` + `ctx.projectFiles.resolveProjectDir` — a
 * project-store lookup plus a metadata-driven directory resolver, both
 * product-specific (see `packages/http/source-map.md`'s routes-classification
 * table, rows `#11 terminal.ts` and `#23 host-tools.ts`, both of which name
 * exactly this dependency as the reason `POST /api/projects/:id/open-in` and
 * the interactive-terminal spawn route were not ported earlier). The kernel
 * has no concept of "project," so it cannot hardcode that lookup — but it
 * also must not silently invent a directory (guessing `process.cwd()` or an
 * OS temp dir would let one request's resource reference leak into an
 * unrelated working directory).
 *
 * Follows the same explicit-injection, conservative-default shape this repo
 * already established for `@jini/cli`'s `resolveDaemonUrl`
 * (`packages/cli/src/daemon-url.ts`): a host supplies a resolver callback; the
 * built-in default resolves nothing and the resolution function throws
 * rather than guessing. It also mirrors `active-context.ts`'s
 * `resolveResource` DI shape (a caller-supplied lookup replacing OD's
 * `getProject`) and its `resourceRef`/`detail` field naming.
