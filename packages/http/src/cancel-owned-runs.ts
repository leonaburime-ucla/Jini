/**
 * Terminate every still-active run scoped to a `contextRef` before the caller
 * deletes whatever host-side record that `contextRef` names (a workspace, a
 * conversation, a project — the kernel has no opinion). Ported from OD's
 * `apps/daemon/src/routes/project/cancel-owned-runs.ts` (`refactor/web-memory-slice`,
 * `cancelRunsOwnedBy`) — see `source-map.md`.
 *
 * Deleting the owning record must not orphan a live run: without this the
 * run's driver keeps consuming resources, the run stays non-terminal with no
 * remaining owner, and (for a filesystem-backed context) a driver may keep
 * writing into a directory that was just removed out from under it. The
 * `RunLifecycle` already knows how to stop a run — `cancel` records
 * cancellation intent and is a no-op on an already-terminal run — so a
 * delete handler just has to call this for the runs it would otherwise
 * strand.
 *
 * OD's original scoped on `{conversationId?, projectId?}` and filtered via a
 * `status: 'active'` argument to its own `list`. The kernel's `RunLifecycle`
 * keys runs on one opaque `contextRef` (extraction-plan §2.1) and its
 * `list(contextRef?)` has no status filter, so this port takes a single
 * `contextRef` and filters non-terminal runs client-side via
 * `isTerminalRunState` instead.
