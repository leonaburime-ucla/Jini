/**
 * @module health
 *
 * `GET /health`, `GET /api/health` (plain liveness — always `200 {ok: true, version}` once the
 * process is up, no dependency checks), `GET /ready`, `GET /api/ready` (real readiness —
 * delegates to an injected `checkReadiness`, `503` when it reports `ok: false`), and `GET
 * /version`, `GET /api/version` (echoes the running build's version). Both the mount-relative
 * and `/api`-prefixed form of each probe are registered because `api-security-middleware.ts`'s
 * `OPEN_PROBE_PATHS` already anticipated exactly these six paths as always-open (no bearer token,
 * no origin check) — this module is what finally makes that anticipated set of paths real routes
 * instead of an open gate over nothing.
 *
 * **Mount before `express.json()`/the bearer-auth/origin-guard middleware** (see
 * `@jini/node-host`'s `create-local-node-daemon.ts` wiring): these are simple parameterless GETs
 * with no request body, so nothing here needs JSON body-parsing, and a monitoring probe should
 * never need a bearer token or same-origin `Origin` header just to confirm the process is up —
 * the same reasoning `api-security-middleware.ts`'s own doc already gives for exempting these
 * paths.
 *
 * **`daemon-status.ts#daemonStatusRoute`'s own doc previously called `GET /api/daemon/status` "a
 * health-check" — this module is the real, purpose-built answer to that now.** `/api/daemon/status`
 * still exists and still reports version/host/port/data-dir/shutdown state (useful operator
 * detail), but a liveness/readiness monitor should poll `/health`/`/ready` instead: those are
 * unauthenticated by design (see above), `/api/daemon/status` is not gated same-origin either
 * today, but was never *documented* as the liveness contract — see that module's updated doc
 * comment.
 *
 * **OD-parity, verified live 2026-07-22** by booting a real Open Design daemon (`apps/daemon/bin/
 * od.mjs --no-open`, from a full clone of `nexu-io/open-design`) and curling its real
 * `/api/health`, `/api/ready`, `/api/version` handlers (`apps/daemon/src/server.ts:2624-2642`).
 * Live responses observed: `GET /api/health` → `200 {"ok":true,"version":"0.15.1"}`; `GET
 * /api/ready` → `200 {"ok":true,"ready":true,"version":"0.15.1"}` (the handler's readiness check
 * is a single `!daemonShuttingDown` boolean, not a pluggable checks map — `server.ts:2629-2637`);
 * `GET /api/version` → `200 {"version":{"version":"0.15.1","channel":"development",
 * "packaged":false,"platform":"darwin","arch":"x64"}}` (the full `AppVersionInfo` shape from
 * `app-version.ts:12-18`, nested under the `version` key — not a bare string). Confirmed OD
 * registers no bare (non-`/api`-prefixed) `/health`/`/ready`/`/version` routes at all (`GET
 * /health` 404s live) — this module's mount-relative variants are a deliberate Jini generalization
 * for hosts that don't prefix their API under `/api`, not an OD-observed route. Also confirmed no
 * origin/CORS headers appear on any of the three live OD responses — `requireLocalDaemonRequest`
 * (`http/local-daemon-request.ts`), which is what stamps `Vary: Origin`/`Access-Control-*`
 * headers on other `/api/daemon/*` routes like shutdown, is never applied to health/ready/version,
 * matching this module's `requireSameOrigin`-unset routes.
 *
 * Two real gaps that live comparison caught and this module now fixes: `livenessRoute` and
 * `readinessRoute` used to omit `version` entirely, and `readinessRoute`'s success body had no
 * `ready` field — both now present, sourced from the same `deps.getVersion()` already wired for
 * `/version`. One gap intentionally left open: `/version`'s response here stays a flat `{version:
 * string}` (via the same string-returning `getVersion` convention `daemon-status.ts` already
 * uses) rather than OD's nested `AppVersionInfo` object — the channel/packaged/platform/arch
 * fields aren't wired anywhere in Jini today (`@jini/node-host`'s `create-local-node-daemon.ts`
 * only ever supplies a plain version string), and inventing that plumbing is a host-level decision
 * out of this file's scope, not something to paper over with an unused type change here.
