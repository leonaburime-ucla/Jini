// to an empty module (verified via the package's own esbuild transform: zero
// emitted statements), so v8/istanbul coverage has no executable line to
// measure and reports 0/0 as 0% rather than N/A. Excluded from the feature's
// coverage run via `--coverage.exclude` (see packages/ui/source-map.md's
// browser-chrome section) rather than chasing a phantom gap.
