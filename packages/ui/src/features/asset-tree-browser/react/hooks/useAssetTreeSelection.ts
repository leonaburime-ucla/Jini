 * disappears from the current listing (a delete or a refresh) — mirrors
 * `features/asset-grid`'s `useAssetGridSelection`, scoped to `path` instead
 * of `id`.
 *
 * `pendingRenamePath` (the path `useAssetTreeRename` currently has in
 * flight, if any) is exempted from pruning. Without this, a host that
 * updates its `files` prop as soon as `onRenameFile` resolves — before
 * `AssetTreeBrowser`'s own `onRenamed` callback gets to call `renamePath`
 * below — creates a real race: the old path vanishes from `filesAtCurrentDir`
 * and gets pruned away *before* `renamePath` runs, so `renamePath`'s own
 * `prev.has(oldPath)` guard (see below) then finds nothing to carry over and
 * silently no-ops, dropping the selection. Keeping the in-flight path "live"
 * for pruning purposes closes that window; once the rename actually
 * resolves, `renamePath` swaps it for the new path, which is by then always
 * present in the caller's updated `files`.
