 * Every other host-specific action (open/rename/delete/upload/get-file-url/

 * the `AssetTreeBrowser` component instead, the same reasoning
 * `features/asset-grid/ports.ts` gives for keeping `onDeleteAsset` a
 * callback prop rather than a port — there's no second real transport a
 * host would ever swap in for "rename this file" or "here's the file's
 * URL", so a port interface would just be ceremony around a single call.
