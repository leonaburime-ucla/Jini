/**
 * Generic "tabbed dialog" shell types.
 *
 * Extracted (2026-08-13) from `SettingsDialogShell` (`../settings/dialog/`) once a downstream
 * consumer was mounting that shell for five different screens — only one of them (`SettingsUi.tsx`)
 * was actually Settings; `AgentPlugins.tsx`, `AiAssistant.tsx`, `Authentication.tsx`, and
 * `PlaceholderTabs.tsx` were reusing "the settings dialog" purely for its generic tabbed
 * chrome. `SettingsDialogShell` now composes this module and supplies its own
 * settings-flavoured label defaults (`t('Settings')`, `t('Settings sections')`, …) — see
 * that component's doc comment. Original provenance: `SettingsDialog.tsx` (8,538 lines) in
 * the vendored OD reference tree — see `packages/ui/source-map.md`.
 *
 * Only the dialog SHELL (sidebar nav + active-panel switching + modal chrome) is modeled
 * here; a host supplies its own tabs as tab entries.
 *
 * Kept free of a `panel`/`icon` field on purpose: those are inherently React-shaped (JSX to
 * render), so they live on the `react/`-layer prop type (`TabbedDialogTab` in
 * `react/components/TabbedDialog.tsx`), which extends `TabbedDialogTabMeta` below with the
 * render-specific fields. This file stays free of any `react` import, per this package's
 * React-layout policy (see `packages/ui/README.md`).
