/**
 * White-screen detector.
 *
 * Reports `client_white_screen` when the app fails to mount within
 * `timeoutMs`. Detection sets a single timer at install time and cancels
 * itself the moment the app mounts real content — a normal boot produces
 * zero events.
 *
 * Success condition (anything below counts as "still showing a pre-mount
 * skeleton" and the timer keeps running):
 *
 *   1. `mountedAttribute` is set on `<html>` to `mountedAttributeValue`
 *      (the host's root component sets this in its very first effect).
 *      This is the authoritative signal — once the root has rendered at
 *      all, any later tree crash is a runtime-exception story, not a
 *      white-screen story.
 *   2. *Fallback only.* If the attribute is missing (a render-time crash
 *      that prevented the effect from firing, or a host build predating
 *      the marker), any non-loading-shell child of the root with more than
 *      `minVisibleText` visible text counts as mounted.
 *
 * This does not try to discriminate "still loading" from "white screen
 * caused by a render error" — both look the same to the user, and the
 * latter usually accompanies a runtime exception a host's own error
 * tracking already captured.
