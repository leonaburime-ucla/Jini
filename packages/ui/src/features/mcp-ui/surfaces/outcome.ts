/**
 * @module features/mcp-ui/surfaces/outcome
 *
 * A read-only RESULT surface: the human already answered a confirmation (or submitted a form, or a
 * background action finished) and this is what actually happened, not what was proposed.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `document.ts`'s `DEFAULT_SURFACE_STATUS_TEXT.done` ("Done.") fires the instant a surface's
 * `tools/call` RESOLVES — that proves the call reached the Host and came back, never that the
 * underlying operation actually succeeded. A publish that 404s, a rejected credential, and a
 * partial upload all resolve the SAME call and render the SAME "Done.". Worse, for a HELD-OPEN
 * confirmation answered through `mcp-ui-tool-calls-route.ts`'s Shape 1 (an exchange delivery), the
 * click's own `tools/call` round trip resolves the instant the answer is DELIVERED to the parked
 * agent call (`{delivered: true}`, HTTP 202) — long before that parked call has actually finished
 * doing the real work the human just approved. "Done." can fire before the real operation has even
 * started.
 *
 * `McpUiSurfaceCard`'s own doc (`@jini-ai/chat`) already names the fix this builder exists to use:
 * "a stream may re-send an updated document for a surface already on screen (a confirmation that
 * became a result), so the LAST event for each URI wins." A caller that finishes a confirmed action
 * re-emits THIS builder's resource under the SAME `ui://` URI the confirmation used, and the
 * transcript replaces the dialog with the real result in place — no second frame, and (since
 * `McpUiHost` keys its iframe by `sessionKey`, which defaults to the document text) no leftover
 * Confirm/Cancel buttons a human could click again on a request that already ran.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `ConfirmationSurfaceSpec` with `confirm` made optional
 *
 * A confirmation's whole shape exists to hold a token the model must never read and to let a human
 * ANSWER something. A result has already been answered — there is nothing left to confirm, cancel,
 * or submit, so `confirm`/`cancel`'s tool-call plumbing has no honest value here. Reusing that type
 * would mean either fabricating a placeholder `confirm` nobody should click, or forking the type at
 * every call site into "sometimes required, sometimes not" — worse than a small, purpose-built
 * sibling that carries only what a result needs.
 *
 * ## The one interactive element this DOES carry
 *
 * `openLinkUrl` renders a single button wired to the bridge's existing `openLink` (`ui/open-link`) —
 * no new bridge plumbing: a `<a href>` is dead inside this package's sandboxed `srcdoc` frame (no
 * `allow-top-navigation`), so `openLink` is the only way an isolated frame can navigate anything at
 * all (`bridge.ts`'s own header). The URL is ALSO always rendered as a plain detail row regardless —
 * copyable/selectable text that needs no script to be useful, matching this package's general
 * "the document should say something true even if a caller never runs its script" posture.
