/**
 * @module features/mcp-ui/surfaces/tokens
 *
 * The design tokens every generated surface declares, and the reason they are declared *in the
 * document* rather than referenced from a stylesheet.
 *
 * A surface renders in a sandboxed, opaque-origin iframe with no network and no shared stylesheet.
 * An undeclared custom property there does not fall back to a host value — there is no host value
 * to fall back to — it resolves to nothing, and the declaration using it is dropped. So a token
 * referenced but not declared is not a degraded style, it is an invisible one: text with no color,
 * a button with no background. {@link renderTokenBlock} exists so every surface's first `<style>`
 * tag declares the complete set, always, and `var(--x, fallback)` is reserved for values that are
 * genuinely optional rather than used as insurance against this failure.
 *
 * The derived tokens below are `color-mix()` expressions over the base tokens rather than second
 * color literals. That is what makes the palette reskinnable: overriding `--jini-mcpui-accent`
 * alone moves the accent, its hover state, its focus ring, and its tinted background together,
 * because all four resolve through it.
 *
 * `@jini-ai/ui` has no package-wide custom-property design system to reuse (checked: its only two
 * stylesheets, `react/chat/styles/reference.css` and the Remix icon font, declare no custom
 * properties at all), so these are namespaced `--jini-mcpui-*` to stay out of the way of one if it
 * ever lands.
 *
 * ## Dark mode
 *
 * {@link SURFACE_TOKENS_DARK} is the same key set with dark values, applied by
 * {@link renderTokenBlock} inside a `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block that redeclares only
 * the base tokens — never {@link DERIVED_TOKENS}. A derived token's own declaration still says
 * `color-mix(in srgb, var(--jini-mcpui-accent) …)`; it does not need a dark-specific line because the
 * browser resolves that `var()` against whichever `--jini-mcpui-accent` cascades on the element at
 * used-value time, light or dark. Redeclaring a derived token per scheme would just be two ways to
 * get the same answer with an extra place for them to drift.
 *
 * Currently moot: {@link FORCE_LIGHT_SURFACE_THEME} suppresses the dark block entirely, because
 * `prefers-color-scheme` reads the OS/browser, not any real app theme — see that constant's own doc.
 */

/**
 * The base palette, radius scale, and font stack.
 *
 * Font stacks are system-only and always will be: a sandboxed iframe has no network, so an
 * `@import` or a `<link>` to a web font is a request that cannot be made, and the surface would
 * render in whatever the engine falls back to after a delay.
