/**
 * @file Decorates every canvas element a host recognizes as an unresolved embed marker with an
 * explicit "this is a placeholder, not real content" card, so an operator editing a document in the
 * canvas sees something intentional where an embed will render instead of an empty, unlabeled element
 * that looks safe to delete by accident.
 *
 * Same seam as `canvas-content-wrapper.ts`, for the identical reason: this module has zero knowledge
 * of what an "embed marker" IS (that convention — `data-embed-config`, a `{"type":...}` JSON payload —
 * belongs to a host; see `@jini-ai/admin/react`'s `InteractiveHtmlEditor` for the one that supplies
 * it), and it runs on GrapesJS's `load` event against the live canvas DOM
 * (`editor.Canvas.getBody()`), never through the `components` string GrapesJS's exported
 * `getHtml()`/`getCss()` are built from. See that sibling file's header for the fuller argument; the
 * short version: GrapesJS's export walks its own component MODEL, which is fixed at
 * `grapesjs.init({ components: html })` and never re-reads the canvas iframe's live DOM afterward, so
 * anything this module adds to that DOM later is invisible to export by construction, not because of a
 * strip-on-save step that could be forgotten or miss a case.
 *
 * **The marker element is never given new children of its own — a NEW wrapper is built around it
 * instead, and the marker is MOVED inside that wrapper (never cloned), exactly the "move, never clone"
 * technique `canvas-content-wrapper.ts` uses to keep GrapesJS's component-view `.el` references
 * intact.** This is the one place this module's technique goes beyond a plain copy of that sibling's,
 * and the reason is a real, currently-open hazard specific to embed markers: a marker element is not
 * guaranteed to be excluded from GrapesJS's own RTE (rich-text-editing) machinery by a host's
 * `isProtectedElement` predicate — see `InteractiveHtmlEditor.tsx` (`@jini-ai/admin/react`)'s own doc
 * for that gap. If GrapesJS ever treats a marker element as an editable `text` component, an edit
 * gesture on it triggers `ComponentTextView.syncContent`, which re-parses that element's LIVE
 * `innerHTML` back into the component model. Putting the card's markup INSIDE the marker would hand
 * that re-parse something real to capture into a saved document; putting it in a wrapper AROUND the
 * (untouched, still literally empty) marker means there is nothing inside the marker for that re-parse
 * to ever pick up, regardless of whether that `isProtectedElement` gap is ever closed.
 *
 * Re-entrancy (defensive, mirroring `canvas-content-wrapper.ts`'s own `WRAPPER_ROOT_MARKER` guard): a
 * marker already sitting inside a placeholder card (`el.closest('[' + CARD_ROOT_MARKER + ']')`) is
 * skipped, so a second call — or a caller's own `load` handler firing twice — cannot nest a second card
 * around an already-decorated marker.
 */

/**
 * Carries the marker's own RESOLVED `max-width`, if it has one, onto the card — a second,
 * complementary mechanism to the literal `style` attribute copy in `applyCanvasEmbedPlaceholders`,
 * and the one that actually matters against a real GrapesJS canvas.
 *
 * **Why a second mechanism is needed at all.** Confirmed live against a real canvas (not discoverable
 * in a plain-DOM unit test — GrapesJS itself hangs under jsdom, see this file's own testing note):
 * GrapesJS's parser does NOT leave an authored `style="max-width:600px"` as a literal attribute on the
 * live element it renders. It converts it into a scoped CSS rule instead (`CssComposer`, keyed by the
 * component's own generated id — `#iow1b { max-width: 600px }` in a canvas `<style>` tag), so
 * `el.getAttribute('style')` finds nothing to copy for every REAL marker despite working correctly
 * against a bare, non-GrapesJS element. `getComputedStyle` reads the RESOLVED value regardless of
 * which of those two forms produced it, so it is what actually reaches a real canvas.
 *
 * Scoped to `max-width` alone (not a wholesale computed-style copy) on purpose: copying every resolved
 * property would fight this card's own deliberately theme-independent, opaque chrome (font, colors,
 * spacing) with whatever the surrounding page happens to compute — the one thing worth inheriting is
 * the box-width constraint the "respect the author's own wrapper" requirement is actually about, not
 * the marker's full computed style.
 *
 * A no-op wherever `getComputedStyle` cannot resolve anything meaningful — no global (a non-browser
 * test environment), or a marker with no width constraint at all (`'none'`, the property's initial
 * value, or an empty string for a detached node with no attached window) — which is also exactly the
 * behavior every existing caller of this module had before this function existed.
