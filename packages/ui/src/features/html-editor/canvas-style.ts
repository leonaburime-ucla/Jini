/**
 * @file Builds the `canvas.frameStyle` GrapesJS injects into its editing canvas, so a host that
 * supplies its own canvas styling is not silently overruled by GrapesJS's own defaults.
 *
 * GrapesJS injects `canvas.frameStyle` as a `<style>` element in the canvas document's **`<body>`**,
 * after everything `canvas.styles` puts in `<head>` — confirmed live in Chrome by reading
 * `iframe.contentDocument`: the head held only the host's `<link>`, and the `body { background-color:
 * #fff }` rule that beat it sat in a body-level `<style>`. Its default value therefore wins the
 * cascade against any host stylesheet that sets a body background, at equal specificity, purely on
 * document order. Left alone, a host loading a dark theme's stylesheet into the canvas gets that
 * theme's near-white `color` on GrapesJS's hardcoded white background — white-on-white text, which is
 * strictly worse than the unstyled canvas it replaced.
 *
 * So the white body background is emitted only when the host supplies no canvas styling of its own.
 * The scrollbar rules are kept either way: they are chrome for GrapesJS's own scrolling canvas, not a
 * statement about the edited document.
