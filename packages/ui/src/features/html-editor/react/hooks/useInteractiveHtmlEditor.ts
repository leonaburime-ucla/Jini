/**
 * @file `InteractiveHtmlEditor`'s GrapesJS lifecycle: construct the editor once per mount against
 * the container ref, wire content-change notifications out, and tear the editor down on unmount.
 * Split from the component the same reason `ConfirmDialog.hooks.tsx` is split from `ConfirmDialog.tsx`
 * in `@jini-ai/admin` — the imperative, non-React lifecycle (`grapesjs.init`/`editor.destroy`) stays
 * out of the render path, and a test can drive it independently of the markup.
 *
 * **Uncontrolled by design.** `html` (and `isProtectedElement`, and `canvasStyling`) are read once,
 * at construction — this hook does not react to later changes in any of them. GrapesJS owns an internal component tree
 * once initialized; feeding an external string back into a live editor on every parent re-render
 * (which is what a naive `useEffect([html])` would do, since this same hook's own `onChange` callback
 * pushes edits back up into whatever state produced the `html` prop) would either fight the operator's
 * cursor or require diffing GrapesJS's tree against a string to detect "did this change come from us",
 * which is real complexity this component's text-editing-only scope does not need. A host that needs a
 * fresh document only mounts this component while it's active and remounts with fresh `html` — see
 * `@jini-ai/admin/react`'s `InteractiveHtmlEditor` adapter and its caller in Tovu's `PageEditor.tsx`.
 *
 * **This module has zero knowledge of what "protected" means.** It only knows how to register a
 * locked GrapesJS component type for whatever `isProtectedElement` predicate its caller supplies —
 * see this file's `registerProtectedElementType`. The predicate itself (e.g. recognizing a host's own
 * embed-placeholder convention) belongs to the caller, not this primitive.
 *
 * **`canvasStyling.contentWrapper` is applied on `load`, against the live canvas — never folded into
 * `components` above.** See `../../canvas-content-wrapper.ts`'s own file header for why: GrapesJS's
 * exported HTML/CSS are built from its component model, which `components` seeds and this wrapper
 * never touches, so it cannot leak into a save no matter how the canvas is edited afterward.

 * GrapesJS's component-tree re-sync (before any edit, GrapesJS passes an unparsed `<style>` block
 * through untouched, masking this; after one real edit, `getHtml()`'s output is built fresh from the
 * component model, which has no CSS in it at all — reproduced with a real page's content: one text
 * edit took `getHtml()`'s output from 8215 characters down to 3160, `<style>` block and all rules
 * gone, the typed edit itself the only thing that survived). `keepUnusedStyles: true` on `getCss()`
 * matters here specifically: real documents commonly carry `@media` blocks and `::before`/`::after`
 * rules that don't correspond to any single "matched" component in the tree — GrapesJS's default CSS
 * export can drop rules it doesn't consider currently referenced, which would silently re-lose exactly
 * the kind of rule a real design (dark-mode variants, decorative pseudo-elements) depends on.

/**
 * Owns one GrapesJS `Editor` instance for the lifetime of the calling component's mount. `onChange`
 * fires with the editor's current serialized content (see `serializeEditorContent`) on every content
 * mutation (GrapesJS's `update` event — components, styles, or attributes changing); it is not
 * debounced, so a caller replacing an existing uncontrolled `<textarea>` (which already pushes a full
 * value on every keystroke) sees matching behavior.
 *
 * **Mounts into a dedicated child node, not the wrapper div `containerRef` itself, and removes that
 * child node (not just its content) on cleanup.** Defensive, for React StrictMode's dev-time
 * double-invoke (mount -> cleanup -> mount again, synchronously): if a destroyed instance's canvas
 * were still mid-render when cleanup ran, clearing the container's *current* content at that moment
 * cannot remove DOM that does not exist yet, and a later async write from the discarded instance
 * would land after the fact. Detaching the whole per-instance node sidesteps that class of ordering
 * problem entirely — whatever a destroyed instance's async work later does, it mutates a node no
 * longer connected to `document`, so it can never become visible or queryable in the live page no
 * matter when it runs. (Investigated live via Playwright while chasing an unrelated symptom — two
 * canvas iframes coexisting after one mount — which turned out to be a separate, harmless GrapesJS
 * quirk unrelated to StrictMode: `Canvas`'s `FramesView` always constructs one `FrameView` that never
 * proceeds past construction to `render()`, alongside the real one; it keeps Backbone's default
 * `class="frame"` forever, inert and unrendered. `.gjs-frame` — the class `FrameView.render()`
 * assigns — is what callers should select on, never a bare `iframe` under the wrapper.)
 *
 * @complexity O(1) setup/teardown. Steady-state cost is GrapesJS's own serialization per edit,
 * proportional to document size — not something this hook controls or should hide a note about
 * beyond that.
