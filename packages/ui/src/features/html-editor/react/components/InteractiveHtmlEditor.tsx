/**
 * @file A visual, click-into-text editing surface for a bespoke HTML document, built on GrapesJS
 * (MIT). Renders `html` like a live preview but lets the operator click into rendered text and edit
 * it in place, with a small Rich Text Editor toolbar (bold/italic/link) — not a structured-document
 * editor: `html` in, edited `html` out via `onChange`, the same contract as an HTML source
 * `<textarea>`. See `react/hooks/useInteractiveHtmlEditor.ts` for why this is uncontrolled
 * (mount-once) rather than reacting to `html`/`isProtectedElement` prop changes after construction.
 *
 * **Scope, this pass: text editing + basic formatting only.** GrapesJS also does drag/drop block
 * manipulation, a Style Manager, and a Layers panel; none of that chrome is enabled here (`panels:
 * { defaults: [] }`, `blockManager: { blocks: [] }` in the hook) — Gutenberg-style block
 * move/duplicate/lock/group is explicitly deferred, not merely unbuilt.
 *
 * **`GJS_STYLE_VARS` below is a consequence of that same choice, not a separate styling decision.**
 * GrapesJS's own vendor CSS unconditionally reserves layout space for the default chrome this
 * component turns off — `.gjs-cv-canvas`'s width is `calc(100% - var(--gjs-left-width))` (default
 * `15%`, for a left Layers/Blocks column that never renders here) and its top offset is
 * `var(--gjs-canvas-top)` (default `40px`, for a top panel bar that also never renders) — confirmed
 * live by measuring the rendered canvas: it sat 197px narrower than its own wrapper at a 1300px
 * wrapper width, exactly `15%`. Left un-overridden, every host gets a dead gray gap on the canvas's
 * right and top edges. Zeroing both variables, scoped to this component's own wrapper via inline
 * style (cascades to the GrapesJS-owned descendants below it), is this component's responsibility to
 * get right once — not something every host integrating it should have to rediscover and patch in
 * its own stylesheet.
 *
 * **This component has zero knowledge of any host's embed/placeholder conventions.** `isProtectedElement`
 * is an optional predicate the caller supplies to lock specific elements (identified however the
 * caller likes) out of every GrapesJS interaction that could edit, move, or remove them — not
 * editable, draggable, droppable, removable, or selectable. When omitted, no elements are protected.
 * `describeEmbedPlaceholder` is the same idea for a second, independent concern: recognizing an
 * unresolved embed marker and labeling it for `../../canvas-embed-placeholders.ts`'s explicit
 * placeholder card. See `@jini-ai/admin/react`'s `InteractiveHtmlEditor` for a worked example of both:
 * it composes this primitive with a predicate recognizing Tovu's legacy `data-embed-type` convention
 * for the first, and a describer recognizing the current `data-embed-config` convention for the
 * second.
 *
 * ## Styling contract
 *
 * This component imports GrapesJS's own vendor stylesheet (`grapesjs/dist/css/grapes.min.css`),
 * because GrapesJS's canvas/RTE chrome does not render usably without it. This is not authored
 * product styling a host would want to override — it is a third-party editor's own required CSS, the
 * same category of dependency as shipping a `<video>` element would carry the browser's native
 * controls chrome. The host's own `.interactive-html-editor` wrapper class is still available for
 * layout (sizing, borders) it wants to apply.
 *
 * Styling the EDITED DOCUMENT is a separate concern, and the host's: `canvasStyling` supplies the
 * stylesheets and raw CSS the canvas document itself renders against, so `html` is edited looking
 * the way it will publish instead of against browser defaults. Neither half reaches `onChange` —
 * GrapesJS keeps `canvas.styles`/`canvas.frameStyle` out of its exported code, and
 * `useInteractiveHtmlEditor`'s `serializeEditorContent` builds its output from the component tree
 * and the `CssComposer`, neither of which these touch. Omit it to edit against browser defaults on
 * GrapesJS's white canvas, which is what every caller got before the option existed. See
 * `../../canvas-style.ts` for why supplying it also has to displace GrapesJS's own default canvas
 * background.
 *
 * `canvasStyling.contentWrapper` adds a third half to that same contract: the real DOM ancestor chain
 * (e.g. `<main><article class="post-detail wrap">`) the host's own page template wraps `html` in, so
 * the canvas centers/pads content the same way the published page does instead of full-bleed. Also
 * never reaches `onChange` — see `../../canvas-content-wrapper.ts`'s file header for why that is
 * guaranteed by WHEN it is applied (against the live canvas, after GrapesJS has already parsed
 * `html`), not by a strip-on-export step.
