/**
 * Pure types for the file-dropzone feature. No React.
 *
 * Consolidates two independent OD file-staging zones into one
 * primitive (see `packages/ui/source-map.md` for the full consolidation
 * writeup): `DesignSystemAssetDropzone.tsx` (a rich, kind-aware thumbnail
 * grid over staged `File[]`) and `DesignSystemFlow.tsx`'s `DropZone` (a
 * labeled, prompt-driven zone with a file-dialog cancel-vs-still-loading
 * detection heuristic). Both are "a native drag/drop + click-to-browse
 * surface that resolves to a flat `File[]`" — this type set covers the
 * union of what either shape needs.
