// Connector-list reconciliation (merge/apply-statuses/status-changed) is NOT
// re-derived here. `@jini/ui`'s `features/connectors/rules.ts` already ships
// `mergeConnectors`/`applyConnectorStatuses`/`hasConnectorStatusChanges`/
// `connectorAuthSnapshotChanged` — generified ports of the exact same
// reconciliation reducers OD's `connectors-state.ts` module has on
// its current `main` (confirmed by direct comparison; see
// `packages/ui/source-map.md`'s provenance note for this feature). This slice
// imports and reuses those instead of shipping a third near-duplicate copy,
// per `foundry/docs/jini-port/god-components-extraction-plan.md`'s Consolidation map,
// which flags this exact overlap and asks each future extraction to check
// for it. Only the two transforms with no equivalent in `features/connectors`
// stay here: the tool-cursor-aware single-connector merge this slice's
// discovery hydration needs, and the "mark pending authorization" transform.
