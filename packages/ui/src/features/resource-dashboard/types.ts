/**
 * Generic status-badged resource-dashboard primitives.
 *
 * Provenance: `docs/jini-port/god-components-extraction-plan.md`'s "5 more
 * overlaps" section flagged "Resource-dashboard shell, twice, both directly
 * Run-vocabulary-relevant": `DesignsTab.tsx` (sub-tab sort + search +
 * select-mode/bulk-delete + per-item kebab menu + a grid/kanban view toggle
 * over a config-driven status-kanban board) and `TasksView.tsx` (hero header
 * with metric tiles + a flat row-list with inline per-item action buttons +
 * a lazy-loaded expandable per-row run-history sublist). Both were read in
 * full from `/tmp/od-source` (see `packages/ui/source-map.md`'s
 * `features/resource-dashboard/` section for the full shared-vs-separate
 * verdict and quoted structural evidence).
 *
 * Verdict: genuinely TWO distinct composition shapes, not one. The only
 * piece that is actually identical between the two origins is "a status
 * value renders as a small badge" plus "group a list of status-bearing
 * items into ordered buckets" — DesignsTab uses that grouping to build a
 * whole-page kanban board; TasksView never groups by status at all (its
 * only status usage is a per-row/per-run `StatusPill`, one level deeper
 * than DesignsTab's top-level items). So this feature ships ONE shared
 * status vocabulary + `StatusPill` + `groupItemsByStatus` rule, consumed by
 * TWO separately composed components: `ResourceBoard` (the DesignsTab
 * shape) and `ResourceRowList` (the TasksView shape). Neither is generic
 * over the other; forcing them through one composed shell would mean
 * bolting kanban-grouping onto a shape that never uses it, or bolting
 * expandable nested history onto a shape that never had it.
 */

// --- Shared status vocabulary -------------------------------------------

/**
 * A host-supplied status value + its display label. Never a hardcoded
 * vocabulary: DesignsTab's own 6-value kanban vocabulary
 * (`not_started`/`running`/`awaiting_input`/`succeeded`/`failed`/`canceled`)
 * and TasksView's own 5-value run vocabulary
 * (`succeeded`/`failed`/`running`/`queued`/`canceled`) are two different,
 * non-identical instantiations of this same shape — see
 * `packages/ui/source-map.md` for the note on reconciling either against
 * `@jini/protocol`'s own `RunState` later (explicitly out of scope here).
