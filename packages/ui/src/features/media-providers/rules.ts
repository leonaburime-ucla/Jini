/**
 * Merges the server's providers over the local ones.
 *
 * Three cases, in order:
 *
 * 1. **`daemonProviders == null`** — the server was never reached (as opposed
 *    to reached and empty). Local state is returned untouched. Treating an
 *    unreachable server as "the server has nothing" would wipe local edits on
 *    a network blip, which is why `null` and `{}` must stay distinguishable.
 * 2. **Server reached, manages nothing** — every marker-only local entry is a
 *    stale echo and is dropped. Entries with real local data are KEPT: the
 *    operator typed those and no server has claimed them yet.
 * 3. **Server reached with providers** — each present server entry wins,
 *    EXCEPT where the caller named that provider in `preserveLocalProviderIds`
 *    AND the local entry has recoverable fields. That exception is what stops
 *    a background refresh from overwriting a field being typed. The local
 *    values are layered ON TOP of the server entry (`{...daemon, ...local}`)
 *    rather than replacing it, so server-only markers survive alongside the
 *    edit.
 *
 * Server entries that are not present are skipped entirely — an empty server
 * record must not blank a configured local one.
 *
 * ## `dropProviderIds` — why a preserve list was not enough
 *
 * `preserveLocalProviderIds` can only preserve something that EXISTS locally:
 * case 3 requires `hasRecoverableFields(localEntry)`, and a cleared provider
 * has no local entry at all. So a provider the operator cleared, whose removal
 * has not yet reached the server, was re-created here from the server's own
 * still-present copy — a reload silently put a deleted credential back on
 * screen. A deletion is not a weaker edit; it is an edit the preserve
 * mechanism structurally cannot express, so it needs its own channel.
 * `dropProviderIds` names ids whose local absence is INTENTIONAL and
 * authoritative for this merge, and they are dropped whichever case runs.
