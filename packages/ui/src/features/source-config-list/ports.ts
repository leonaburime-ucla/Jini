/**
 * The DI seam. Everything in this feature reaches transport only through
 * this interface — `dependencies.ts` is the one file allowed to bind a real
 * implementation. Host-injected adapters do the actual network calls; none
 * of the four origin sources' specific endpoints (the daemon's
 * `/api/mcp/servers`, OD's BYOK config endpoint, the plugin-marketplace
 * fetch, etc.) become part of this generic primitive.
 *
 * `refreshSource`/`setTrust`/`testSource` are optional on purpose: not every
 * source shape supports every action (the origin MCP-server shape has no
 * trust concept at all; a plugin marketplace has no per-item connection
 * test). The React layer derives which per-item actions to render from
 * which of these methods a host's port actually implements, rather than a
 * separate set of boolean feature flags a host would have to keep in sync.
