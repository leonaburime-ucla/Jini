// Shared "run this keydown handler for as long as the feature is active"
// plumbing. useAssetGridKeyboardShortcuts (asset-grid) and
// useAnnotationKeyboardShortcuts (annotation-canvas, `@jini/renderers-react`)
// both wrote the identical shape: bail out of the effect while an `active`
// flag is false, otherwise attach one `window` keydown listener and remove it
// on cleanup/deactivation. useSketchDomEnhancements (sketch-editor) wrote the
// same lifecycle-scoped-listener shape twice more, on `document` with the
// capture phase, to win a race against a third-party library's own
// listeners. What's shared across all of these is the subscribe/enable/
// cleanup plumbing — which keys mean what stays entirely feature-owned in the
// `handler` callback passed in.
