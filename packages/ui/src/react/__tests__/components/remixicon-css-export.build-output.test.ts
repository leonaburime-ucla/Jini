/**
 * Asserts the `@jini-ai/ui/remixicon.css` subpath export actually resolves to a usable stylesheet
 * in built output.
 *
 * This is the one claim in `RemixIcon.tsx`'s stylesheet story that `dist/` can settle, and it is
 * load-bearing for all of it: `installRemixIconStylesheet` is only a real escape hatch if the
 * thing every warning message tells a host to import is really there. The chain it depends on has
 * two independently breakable links that no source-level test touches --
 *
 *  1. the `exports` map entry, and
 *  2. a `cp` buried in the middle of `package.json`'s single `&&`-chained `build` script,
 *
 * -- and if either breaks, the export silently 404s while every unit test in this package still
 * passes and the component's own advice becomes wrong. Same reasoning as
 * `agent-icon-data-uris.build-output.test.ts`, which exists because a source-level assertion
 * cannot tell a working asset reference from a broken one.
 *
 * Deliberately derived from the `exports` map rather than a hardcoded path, so a typo *in the
 * export map* fails here rather than only at a host's import.
