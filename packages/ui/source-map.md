# `@jini/ui` — provenance

Origin: `integrations/open-design/reference/web-src-directories/` (vendored
snapshot of OD's `apps/web/src/{runtime,providers,state,lib,media,analytics,
styles}`), per `docs/jini-port/ui-extraction-plan.md` and
`docs/jini-port/recon/r4-webui.md`.

If you are adding a new section to this file, append it below rather than
rewriting the whole document — multiple tasks land content here in parallel
and a merge conflict on this file is expected and fine (the Coordinator
reconciles it).

## Section: runtime/providers/state/lib/media/analytics/styles sweep (2026-07-16)

Scope: fast reusability triage of the 7 directories above (~118 files) per
the Programmer dispatch for this task. Full per-file verdict table is in the
Programmer's handoff report, not duplicated here; this section only covers
what was actually ported.

### Ported

| Jini file | Origin | Transform |
|---|---|---|
| `src/utils/zip.ts` | `runtime/zip.ts` | Verbatim (already zero-dependency, zero OD refs) — minimal stored-mode ZIP encoder. Comment wording lightly reworded (dropped the OD-specific "Download as ZIP button" framing). |
| `src/utils/sse.ts` | `providers/sse.ts` | Verbatim logic (`parseSseFrame`) — already confirmed generic by `docs/jini-port/recon/r4-webui.md` §1c. Comment reworded to describe the generic transport-agnostic use (not OD's specific daemon SSE contract). |
| `src/utils/copy-to-clipboard.ts` | `lib/copy-to-clipboard.ts` | Verbatim. Dropped the comment's reference to OD's `FileViewer.tsx`/issue #451 provenance. |
| `src/utils/appearance.ts` | `state/appearance.ts` | Generified: dropped the `AppTheme` import from OD's `../types` (replaced with a local `AppearanceTheme = 'light' \| 'dark'` union — same two values the function actually branches on). `DEFAULT_ACCENT_COLOR` changed from OD's brand accent (`#c96442`) to a neutral default (`#2563eb`, previously the second swatch) since a shared package should not ship one consumer's brand color as the default; `#c96442` kept as a swatch option. Everything else (CSS custom-property names, `color-mix` formula, `normalizeAccentColor`/`resolveAccentColor`/`applyAppearanceToDocument` logic) is verbatim. |
| `src/utils/dom-subscriptions.ts` | `providers/dom/chat-pane.dom.ts` (`subscribeOutsideClickOrEscape`, `subscribeWindowEvent`, `subscribeVisibleFocusOrVisibilityChange`, `scheduleInterval`, `scheduleTimeout`, `openExternalUrl`, `getDocumentBody`) + `providers/dom/chat-composer.dom.ts` (`getViewportSize`) | Verbatim logic. These two origin files were headed "DOM bridges owned exclusively by the chat-pane/chat-composer slice," but the specific functions ported have zero chat/composer/pane-specific logic in their bodies (pure window/document event-subscription primitives) — re-verified against real usage before lifting, same check `docs/jini-port/ui-extraction-plan.md`'s §A footnotes call out for `composer-detail-position.ts` etc. Functions left behind in the origin files (`readComposerDraft`/`writeComposerDraft`, `openDesignSystemPickerTrigger`, `subscribeComposerPortalRect`, `subscribeComposerLayerHeight`) are domain-specific (composer draft persistence, a composer-specific trigger selector, composer/pane rect-tracking tied to layout assumptions) and were left for `@jini/chat-react`. |

All five files have real unit tests (`*.test.ts` alongside each). None of
`copyToClipboard`/`applyAppearanceToDocument`/`dom-subscriptions.ts` had a
jsdom/happy-dom test environment available in this repo yet (no `jsdom` or
`happy-dom` package installed, no `vitest.config.ts` at the repo root or in
this package) — tests stub the specific `window`/`document`/`navigator`
surface each function touches by hand via `vi.stubGlobal` rather than adding
a new devDependency mid-task. `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` was created
(previously missing) with `lib: ["ES2023", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]` added on
top of the repo's `tsconfig.base.json` so these DOM-touching utilities
typecheck.

### Explicitly not ported (belongs elsewhere or not reusable)

See the Programmer handoff report's full per-file table for the complete
list (~110 files). Summary of the routing decisions:

- **`@jini/chat-react` / `@jini/agent-runtime` territory** (chat/tool/model
  domain, not generic UI): `runtime/{markdown.tsx, shiki.ts, file-ops.ts,
  chat-events.ts (already resolved as not-portable in
  `packages/chat-core/source-map.md`), resume.ts, in-project-link.ts,
  browser-action-executor.ts, design-toolbox.ts}`, `providers/{daemon.ts
  (already known — see r4), anthropic*.ts, *-compatible.ts, api-proxy.ts,
  connection-test.ts, provider-models.ts, elevenlabs-voices.ts}`,
  `providers/dom/{chat-composer.dom.ts, chat-pane.dom.ts}`'s remaining
  domain-specific functions (see table above).
- **`@jini/renderers-react` territory** (artifact/preview rendering):
  `runtime/{srcdoc.ts (deferred, confirmed still present at 2,881 lines —
  not touched), react-component.ts, exports.ts, jsx-module-refs.ts}`,
  `lib/use-deck-preview-scale.ts`.
- **`features/byok-config` territory** (out of scope this task, owned by
  another task per the dispatch brief): `state/apiProtocols.ts` is the exact
  OD-specific data (`SUGGESTED_MODELS_BY_PROTOCOL`, `API_KEY_PLACEHOLDERS`,
  etc.) `docs/jini-port/ui-extraction-plan.md` §B already flags as the
  residue a `ProviderCatalogPort` needs to abstract away; `lib/
  resolve-finalize-request.ts` and `providers/connection-test.ts`/
  `provider-models.ts` are the BYOK finalize/connection-test transport this
  feature's `dependencies.ts` would bind to.
- **`features/mcp-config` territory** (out of scope this task, owned by
  another task): `state/mcp.ts` is the daemon transport (`fetchMcpServers`,
  `saveMcpServers`, MCP OAuth flow) that feature's `dependencies.ts` should
  bind to once that slice is built. Not ported here per the dispatch brief's
  explicit instruction to only note this, not build the slice.
- **Not reusable — OD product-specific** (brand kit, decks/presenter, AMR
  billing, plugins, onboarding, media-provider catalogs, analytics/PostHog
  wiring, project/workspace state): the remainder of `runtime/`
  (amr-*, brand-*, deck-thumbnail-parser.ts, design-kit.ts,
  design-md-parse.ts, design-system-package-audit.ts, kit-*.ts,
  plugin-source.ts, powered-preview.ts, slide-nav.ts, speaker-notes.ts,
  useBrand*.ts), `providers/{registry.ts, project-events.ts}` (already
  flagged OD-specific by r4), all of `state/` except `appearance.ts`
  (`apiProtocols.ts` routed above; `config.ts`, `libraryHandoff.ts`,
  `maxTokens.ts`, `onboarding-profile.ts`, `project-locations.ts`,
  `projects.ts`, `workspace.ts`, `litellm-models.json`), all of `media/`
  (OD's media-generation model registry, daemon-paired), all of `analytics/`
  (every file couples to `@open-design/contracts/analytics` and/or
  `posthog-js`; the host-supplied-tracker *pattern* is a design decision for
  a future `@jini/chat-react` analytics context, not a file to port), and
  the rest of `lib/` (`whats-new.ts`, `build-continue-in-cli-toast.ts`,
  `build-clipboard-prompt.ts`, `parse-provenance.ts`, `pod-members.ts`,
  `updater.ts`).
- **Deferred, not a rejection**: `lib/use-stable-handler.ts`
  (`useStableHandler`) is a genuinely generic React hook (zero OD imports)
  but this package has no React dependency wired up yet (`packages/ui/
  package.json` had none before this task, and no other `@jini/*` package in
  this repo depends on `react` yet either) — porting one hook is not enough
  justification to add the first React/JSX toolchain wiring
  (`react`/`@types/react`, `tsconfig` `jsx` option, etc.) as a side effect of
  a file-triage task. Left for whichever task first adds real `src/
  components/` or `src/hooks/` content that needs React for real.
- **`styles/` — human decision needed, not touched**: this task only ports
  `.ts`/`.tsx`. `styles/tokens.css`, `styles/primitives.css`, and
  `styles/base.css` read as genuinely generic design tokens/resets (color
  vars, button/form primitives, box-sizing reset) worth a human look for a
  future design-tokens package; everything else (`chat.css`,
  `design-system-flow.css`, `shell.css`, `entrance.css`,
  `social-share.css`, `modal-window-drag.css`, `plan-badge.css`, and the
  `home/`, `viewer/`, `workspace/`, `remixicon/` subdirectories) is
  OD-product-specific by name and content.

## Dependencies

None beyond the TypeScript standard library + DOM lib types
(`packages/ui/tsconfig.json` adds `"DOM"`/`"DOM.Iterable"` to the base
`lib` list). No `react` yet (see "Deferred, not a rejection" above). No
`@open-design/*` specifier, no `Open Design`/`OD_`/`--od-stamp`/
`/tmp/open-design` product-identity string — verified by grep across
`packages/ui/src/**`.
