 * CLI transport-shell: HTTP-client-mode generic transport/infra ported from

 * `source-map.md` for the full classification of what was and wasn't
 * ported. This is a first generic slice, not the full `@jini/cli` package —
 * no pack has registered against `CommandRegistry` yet because no HTTP-
 * client-mode pack exists in this repo to call.

// NOTE: `main.ts` (the bootable `jini` binary, wired via `package.json`'s `"bin"` field) is
// deliberately NOT re-exported here. This barrel is imported as a plain library dependency;
// `main.ts` parses `process.argv` and may call `process.exit` as a side effect of being
// imported for real (guarded so that merely importing its named `main` export does not trigger
// that side effect — see `main.ts`'s own module doc) — bundling it into this barrel would mean
// `import '@jini/cli'` could start behaving like a CLI invocation.
