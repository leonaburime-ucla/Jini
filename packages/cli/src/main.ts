/**
 * @module main
 *
 * The bootable `jini` binary (`package.json`'s `"bin": { "jini": "./dist/main.js" }`). Every
 * other module in this package is a library building block — `run-command.ts`,
 * `daemon-command.ts`, and `version-command.ts` each export a `register*Commands(registry,
 * deps)` function ready for a pack to call, but until this file, nothing actually parsed
 * `process.argv` and called them: `packages/cli/source-map.md`'s "Not built" note on
 * `run-command.ts`'s original addition said as much — "no wiring of this file's commands into
 * an actual bootable CLI entrypoint." This closes that gap.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** re-exported from `index.ts`. `index.ts` is this package's library
 * barrel — importing it must be side-effect-free. This file's whole purpose is a
 * process.argv-parsing, stdout/stderr-writing, potentially process.exit-calling side effect;
 * bundling that into the library barrel would mean simply `import`ing `@jini/cli` as a
 * dependency could start acting like a CLI invocation. The guarded top-level block at the
 * bottom of this file (only runs `main()` for real when this module is the actual process
 * entrypoint, not merely imported) exists for the same reason, one level down: importing the
 * named `main` export for testing (or for a consumer that wants to build its own bin wrapper
 * around it) must not itself trigger a real run.
 *
 * **Daemon-URL resolution.** `resolveDaemonUrl` (`daemon-url.ts`) has no baked-in default —
 * this package has never had a locked default daemon port to fall back to (see
 * `source-map.md`: `@jini/node-host`'s `createLocalNodeDaemon` binds an ephemeral port, not a
 * fixed one). This binary wires the three real, already-built pieces together instead of
 * inventing a new one: an explicit `--daemon-url <url>` flag (highest precedence), a
 * `JINI_DAEMON_URL` env var, and — when `--data-dir <path>` or `--registry-path <path>` is
 * given — `local-daemon-discovery.ts`'s `createLocalDaemonDiscovery`, the CLI-side reader for
 * a `@jini/node-host`-written on-disk daemon registry record. That discovery module's own doc
 * already flagged it as built-but-unconsumed ("no pack has registered against
 * `CommandRegistry` yet"); this is that consumer. If none of the three resolve, there is still
 * no silent fallback — `resolveDaemonUrl` throws, and this file's own catch boundary (below)
 * turns that into a clean structured-error exit instead of a raw stack trace.
 *
 * **Global flags are stripped before dispatch, not left for `CommandRegistry`'s `valueFlags`
 * skip-ahead.** `CommandRegistry.dispatch`'s `valueFlags` option (see `command-registry.ts`)
 * correctly *finds* the command-name token when a global flag with a value precedes it (e.g.
 * `--daemon-url http://x run` picks `run`, not the URL) — but the `rest` array it then hands
 * the matched handler still *contains* that leading global flag and its value, ahead of
 * whatever the handler expects as its own first token. That's harmless for a flat command, but
 * `run-command.ts`/`daemon-command.ts`'s own registered handlers immediately do a *second*
 * `const [sub, ...rest] = args` dispatch of their own, assuming `args[0]` is their immediate
 * subcommand (`start`/`status`/etc.) with no tolerance for a stray leading flag — exactly what
 * a global flag ahead of the command name would produce. Rather than change that (well-tested,
 * out-of-scope) nested-dispatch assumption, {@link partitionGlobalArgv} below removes this
 * binary's own three global flags (and their values) from `argv` in a single pass *before*
 * dispatch, so `run`/`daemon`/`version` always land as a clean first token no matter where on
 * the command line `--daemon-url`/`--data-dir`/`--registry-path` were typed.
 *
 * **`--version`/`-v`.** This package's `package.json` is `"private": true` with a placeholder
 * `"0.0.0"` version — not a real, published semver worth printing. Rather than invent one,
 * `jini --version`/`jini -v` (recognized only as the very first token — see {@link main}) is a
 * plain alias for `jini version` (`version-command.ts`): it prints the *running daemon's* real
 * version. That is arguably more useful to a user of this transport-only CLI than this
 * package's own unpublished build number would be, and it means `--version` has exactly one
 * implementation to keep correct, not two.
 *
 * **Error boundary.** `parseFlags` (`flags.ts`) throws a plain `Error` for an unrecognized
 * `--flag` or a string flag with no value — by design (see that module's own doc: "a
 * hallucinated flag from an LLM-driven caller should error immediately"), but every existing
 * command handler (`run-command.ts`, `daemon-command.ts`, `version-command.ts`) calls it
 * un-wrapped, so that throw would otherwise surface as an unhandled rejection with a raw stack
 * trace instead of the clean `{ error: { code, message } }` envelope every *other* failure
 * path in this package produces. {@link main} wraps its dispatch in a boundary that converts
 * any such raw throw into the same structured-error contract. Distinguishing "a raw,
 * unexpected throw" from "a nested command already exited cleanly through
 * `exitWithStructuredError`" (the latter must never be re-wrapped — that would double-report
 * the same failure, or worse, mask the original exit code with a generic one) uses a local
 * flag set by this file's own `exit` wrapper: if the wrapped `exit` was ever invoked before the
 * catch fires, the original error is re-thrown untouched instead of reformatted. In real
 * operation this distinction is moot — `process.exit` never returns, so nothing downstream of
 * a real exit call ever reaches the catch — but it matters for this file's own tests, which
 * (like every other test in this package) inject a throwing `exit` double to make
 * `process.exit`'s real "never returns" behavior observable without ending the test process.
