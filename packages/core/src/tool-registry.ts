/**
 * `ToolRegistry` — the registration half of the tool-execution boundary
 * (extraction-plan.md §2.5 / §8 task 6). Tools are registered as
 * `{descriptor, handler, policy}` triples; the registry's *public* surface
 * (this file's `ToolRegistry` interface, and everything re-exported from
 * this package's root `index.ts`) exposes only `ToolDescriptor`s —
 * `register`/`has`/`list`. It never exposes a way to retrieve a `handler`
 * or `policy` back out.
 *
 * That's the load-bearing invariant this task is named after: "handlers
 * never publicly retrievable (routes/agents can't bypass authz)." A route
 * or an agent holding a `ToolRegistry` reference can enumerate what's
 * available and check membership, but the only way to actually *run* a
 * tool is through `@jini/daemon`'s `ToolExecutor`, which is the sole
 * consumer of {@link getToolRegistration} — a function deliberately
 * exported from `./internal.js` (a package-internal entry point, see this
 * package's `package.json` `exports` map and `source-map.md`) rather than
 * from the public `index.ts` barrel. Every other caller of
 * `@jini/core`'s default entry point gets descriptors only.
