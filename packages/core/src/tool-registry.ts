/**
 * `ToolRegistry` — the registration half of the tool-execution boundary
 * (extraction-plan.md §2.5 / §8 task 6). Tools are registered as
 * `{descriptor, handler, policy}` triples; the registry's *public* surface
 * (this file's `ToolRegistry` interface, and everything re-exported from
 * this package's root `index.ts`) exposes only `ToolDescriptor`s —
 * `register`/`has`/`list`. It never exposes a way to retrieve a `handler`
 * or `policy` back out.
 *
 * That's the load-bearing invariant this task is named after: "handlers
 * never publicly retrievable (routes/agents can't bypass authz)." A route
 * or an agent holding a `ToolRegistry` reference can enumerate what's
 * available and check membership, but the only way to actually *run* a
 * tool is through `@jini-ai/daemon`'s `ToolExecutor`, which is the sole
 * consumer of {@link authorizeToolInvocation} — a function deliberately
 * exported from `./internal.js` (a package-internal entry point, see this
 * package's `package.json` `exports` map and `source-map.md`) rather than
 * from the public `index.ts` barrel. Every other caller of
 * `@jini-ai/core`'s default entry point gets descriptors only.
 * `authorizeToolInvocation` itself runs the tool's `ToolPolicy` (and an
 * optional transport veto) before ever handing back a handler, so a
 * runtime handler closure is unobtainable without already having passed
 * authorization — the earlier design (a separate `getToolRegistration`
 * that returned the handler unconditionally) let any caller of this
 * package-internal entry point skip the gate entirely; see this package's
 * `source-map.md` for the 2026-07-29 hardening note.

 * as a string is what lets a handler drive `mcp-ui`, `a2ui`, or `surface_request` — or a channel
 * that does not exist yet — through one seam.
 *
 * @example mcp-ui — a sandboxed HTML surface; the transport supplies `toolUseId`
 * `{ channel: 'mcp-ui', payload: { resource } }`
 * @example a2ui — a component tree that can be updated repeatedly on one held-open call
 * `{ channel: 'a2ui', payload: { message: createSurface(exchangeId, ...) } }`

 * handler that parks first never emits the thing being answered, and the park can never resolve.
 * That is a deadlock by construction, not a race. This is the seam that breaks it — emit, then await.
 *
 * Callable any number of times before the call settles, which is what makes a multi-turn exchange
 * (A2UI's `createSurface` → action → `updateComponents` → action) expressible on a single tool call
 * rather than only a one-shot ask.
 *
 * Human-only in both directions: emitting never puts anything into model context.
 *
 * Optional because it is transport-supplied. A caller with no run event stream to emit into (a
 * headless or synthetic execution) omits it, and a handler that finds it absent must fall back to
 * returning its surface rather than parking — see the `@jini-ai/daemon` bridge for the supplying end.
