/**
 * `AsyncOperationStore` — the durable operation row behind submit-then-poll media generation.
 *
 * Why this exists alongside `task-store.ts`'s `MediaTaskStore`: they model different things and
 * only one of them survives a restart usefully. `MediaTaskStore` is a *task tracker* — it records
 * that a generation happened and its `reconcileOnBoot` deliberately marks every still-in-flight
 * task `'interrupted'`, because a synchronous `fetch` that died with its process genuinely cannot
 * be resumed. This store is the opposite case: a vendor-side job that is still running *on the
 * vendor* after our process died, and whose result is still retrievable by polling. It therefore
 * carries the four columns a poll loop needs and a task tracker does not — `attempts`,
 * `nextPollAt`, a worker `lease`, and an absolute `deadlineAt` — and its `reconcileOnBoot`
 * *releases* leases rather than terminating the work.
 *
 * Two independent bounds are mandatory, not redundant: `maxAttempts` catches a vendor that answers
 * "pending" forever, and `deadlineAt` catches a vendor that stops answering at all. Neither one
 * subsumes the other.
 *
 * `state` is the vendor's own resumption handle (a job id, a poll URL). It is deliberately
 * validated on every write to reject credential material: the row outlives the process and is the
 * one place a leaked key would become durable. Credentials are re-resolved per poll tick through
 * the signer seam instead — see `polling-adapter.ts`.
 */

/**
 * `unknown` is a real terminal-ish state, not a failure: it means the operation may or may not
 * have taken effect at the vendor and cannot be safely retried without an idempotency proof. It is
 * reachable only from a crash gap or a blown deadline, and exists so those never masquerade as
 * either success or a retryable failure.
