/**
 * The submit-then-poll runtime: the piece that turns a `PollingVendorAdapter` plus an
 * `AsyncOperationStore` into an operation that survives a restart.
 *
 * ## Persist first, then race
 *
 * `startOperation` writes the operation row **before** it issues any HTTP call, then races the
 * in-flight submit against a short interactive grace window. If the vendor answers in time the
 * caller gets `{done: true, result}` in the same round trip — indistinguishable from the
 * synchronous tier. If it does not, the caller gets `{done: false, operationId}` and the *same*
 * in-flight request keeps running and writes its own outcome into the row.
 *
 * That ordering is what makes crash safety fall out for free rather than being bolted on: there is
 * no window in which work exists only inside a process. It is also why this is a race and not a
 * fork — there is exactly one submit code path, and `expectedLatencyClass` only decides how long
 * the caller is willing to wait on it, never what happens.
 *
 * Human callers and agents get the identical contract: a result, or an id to come back with.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT here
 *
 * No scheduler. `pollDueOperations` is a single leased tick a host drives from whatever timer or
 * queue it already runs — this package performs no I/O of its own beyond the vendor calls it is
 * handed a `fetchImpl` for, a standing invariant across `@jini-ai/integrations/media-providers`.
