# `@jini/memory` — provenance

**New package, not yet in the locked §3 package set in
`docs/jini-port/extraction-plan.md`.** Same precedent as `@jini/deploy` and
`@jini/registry`: flagged here for Coordinator/Software-Architect sign-off
before being folded into the locked list.

Built per the task-6 audit's PART B brief off `docs/jini-port/recon/
r1-daemon.md`'s TASK 1 MIXED classification for the daemon's top-level
`memory*.ts`: "memory subsystem... generic capability with OD-shaped
payloads." This is the daemon-side backend capability (extraction/rules/
verification), a completely different thing from `packages/ui/src/features/
memory/`'s `MemorySection.tsx` (the frontend presentation layer, ported
separately in an earlier session).

## Discrepancy in the task brief, flagged rather than silently resolved

The task brief named 7 files: `memory-cleanup.ts`, `memory-connectors.ts`,
`memory-extractions.ts`, `memory-llm.ts`, `memory-rules.ts`,
`memory-verify.ts`, `memory.ts`. On a fresh clone of `leonaburime-ucla/
open-design`'s `refactor/web-memory-slice` branch (the branch the recon doc
itself was written against) and a full-history search (`git log --all
--oneline -- '**/memory-cleanup.ts'` across every branch), **`memory-
cleanup.ts` does not exist anywhere in the OD repository.** Only 6 of the 7
named files are real. This source-map documents what was actually read and
ported/skipped for those 6 — `memory-cleanup.ts` is not addressed because
there is nothing to address.

## Read all 6 files in full; classification per file (not one blanket verdict)

The recon's "generic capability with OD-shaped payloads" description turned
out to fit **only about a third** of this directory's actual content once
read end-to-end. The rest is materially more OD-product-specific than a
one-line recon summary could capture — memory type taxonomies, an
OpenDesign-branded connector-mining assistant, and coding-agent-CLI process
execution, not just "payload shape."

| Origin file | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `memory.ts` | **Split: generic mechanism ported, OD payload/business-logic left behind** | See "What was ported" below. |
| `memory-extractions.ts` | **Ported in full**, as `src/extraction-log.ts` | Already fully generic in the origin — verified zero `@open-design/*` imports; its only coupling was importing `memoryEvents` from `memory.ts`, replaced with the log's own independent `EventEmitter`. |
| `memory-verify.ts` | **Ported: pure algorithm + record log**, as `src/verify.ts` | `enforceVerify`'s rule-coverage matching (`rowCoversRule`, `significantWords`, the STOPWORDS list) is a generic "does this row's text cover this rubric item" algorithm with zero OD content. Its one real coupling — extracting a scorecard from output text via OD's `<od-card type="verify-scorecard">` markup (`splitOnOdCards` from `@open-design/contracts`) — was generalized into a host-supplied `extractScorecard: (output: string) => VerifyScorecard \| null` callback instead of a hardcoded parser. |
| `memory-connectors.ts` | **NOT ported — correctly OD-product, not "generic with OD payload"** | This is an OpenDesign-branded connector-mining assistant: a ~30-pattern regex list of *design-specific* vocabulary (`design system`, `figma`, `typography`, `dark mode`, Chinese design terms) used to filter what counts as "design-relevant," a system prompt literally titled "You are a design-memory extractor for OpenDesign connected-app context," and Notion-specific page-opening heuristics. There is no generic "connector fact-mining" mechanism left over once the design-topic filtering and OD branding are removed — the whole file *is* that filtering. Skipped, not forced. |
| `memory-llm.ts` | **NOT ported — deeply OD-coupled, not cleanly separable in this pass** (later partially revisited — see below) | Three intertwined concerns: (1) a genuinely generic "call one of N LLM HTTP APIs with a system+user prompt, parse strict JSON" sub-pattern (`callAnthropic`/`callOpenAI`/`callAzure`/`callGoogle`) — a real future extraction candidate, noted here for whoever picks this up next; (2) OD-branded system prompts ("personal AI design assistant") and memory-config provider-override shape; (3) local coding-agent-CLI execution (`claude`/`codex`/`opencode` one-shot invocation via `@open-design/platform`'s `createCommandInvocation`, agent env building) that has nothing to do with memory extraction generically — it's "run one of OD's supported coding CLIs headlessly." Attempting to port this file in the time available for this task risked exactly the failure mode called out in the audit-lessons section of the task brief (a declared port whose implementation doesn't hold up); skipped rather than forced. Concern (1) — the flagged "real future extraction candidate" — was picked up and ported on 2026-07-21; see that dated addition below. Concerns (2) and (3) remain NOT ported, unchanged from this original verdict. |
| `memory-rules.ts` | **NOT ported — thin wrapper entirely dependent on the skipped `memory-llm.ts`** | `distillRulesFromAnnotations`'s heuristic pass is a few lines of generic templating, but its LLM pass calls `suggestWithLLM` from the skipped `memory-llm.ts`, and its system prompt is OD-specific ("distil a designer's review annotations..."). Not portable independent of the file above. |

## What was ported from `memory.ts`

The filesystem fact-store *mechanism* — frontmatter-backed entry files, a
human-editable `INDEX.md` of link bullets as the "active set" source of
truth, a minimal `.config.json`, change events, deterministic id derivation
(slugify + FNV-1a hash fallback for non-ASCII names) — is genuinely generic
and was ported as `src/note-store.ts` (`createNoteStore`). **Not ported**
(left as OD product/business logic, not mechanism):

- **The type taxonomy itself.** OD's `MEMORY_TYPES` (`profile`/`user`/
  `feedback`/`project`/`reference`/`rule`) is a fixed, OD-chosen bucket set
  imported from `@open-design/contracts`. Generalized into
  `NoteStoreConfig.validTypes`/`defaultType` — entirely host-supplied.
- **`composeMemoryBody`** (prompt-composition rendering: profile as a
  structured key/value block, rules as a verify-rubric, others as
  `**name** — description` bullets) — this is OD's specific system-prompt UX
  for *how* memory gets injected into a chat turn, not a store capability. A
  host composes its own prompt from `listActiveEntries`/`readEntry`.
- **`listActiveRuleEntries`** — a one-line OD-specific wrapper (`rule`-type
  filter over the active set) now trivially expressible by a host as
  `(await store.listActiveEntries(dataDir)).filter(e => e.type === 'rule')`.
- **The onboarding→profile capture** (`captureProfileFromForm`,
  `parseFormAnswers`, `CANONICAL_PROFILE_LABELS` — OD's specific discovery-
  form field labels like "Organization size"/"Aesthetic / taste") — OD
  product UX, not a store concern.
- **The heuristic regex extraction pack** (`REMEMBER_PATTERNS`,
  `extractFromMessage`) — this is content classification ("does this
  sentence mean 'remember this'?"), not a reusable mechanism; the English/
  Chinese trigger phrases are themselves the entire value of the file.
- **`maskMemoryExtractionConfig`** and the `.config.json` extraction-
  provider-override fields (`chatExtractionEnabled`/`profileEnabled`/
  `rewriteEnabled`/`verifyEnabled`/`extraction`) — these are OD chat-hook
  toggles paired 1:1 with the skipped `memory-llm.ts`/onboarding features.
  The ported config keeps only the generic on/off master switch (`enabled`).

**One deliberate design change beyond de-branding:** the origin's `memory.ts`
shared one module-level `EventEmitter` (`memoryEvents`) across every call
site, which only worked because OD ran exactly one memory store per daemon
process. `createNoteStore`/`createExtractionLog`/`createVerifyLog` are
factories that each return their own independent `EventEmitter` instance, so
multiple stores in one process (or in tests) never cross-fire events.

## `entry-frontmatter.ts` — a new, narrower helper, not the ported
`design-systems/frontmatter.ts`

The note-store entry format needs exactly three flat scalar frontmatter
fields (`name`/`description`/`type`) plus a body. OD's actual frontmatter
parser (`apps/daemon/src/design-systems/frontmatter.ts`) is a fuller
YAML-subset parser (nested objects, arrays, block-literal `|` strings) that
belongs to the `design-systems/` subsystem — a different area, out of this
task's brief (registry/memory/services/migration), and porting the whole
subsystem to satisfy one small caller would be scope creep. `entry-
frontmatter.ts` is a small, self-contained, purpose-built parser/renderer
for exactly the note-store's shape — not a copy or subset extraction of the
design-systems parser, and not a duplicate of it (different scope, no
shared code).

## Dependencies

None beyond Node builtins (`node:fs/promises`, `node:path`, `node:events`,
`node:crypto`).

## Barrel branch reconciliation (`memory-capability-barrel`, 2026-07-18)

A later task re-checked this package against OD's `memory-capability-barrel`
branch. That branch decomposes the same 6 files this package was already
ported from (`memory.ts`, `memory-extractions.ts`, `memory-verify.ts`,
`memory-llm.ts`, `memory-rules.ts`, `memory-connectors.ts`) into a `memory/`
capability-barrel directory (`core/`, `store/`, `extractions/`, `verify/`,
`llm/`, `rules/`, `connectors/`), per its own `apps/daemon/src/memory/
README.md`: "The moves were purely structural — no logic changes."

Verified independently rather than trusted, because `memory-capability-barrel`
and this package's original `refactor/web-memory-slice`-based port are two
different OD branches/points in time and "no logic changes" is exactly the
kind of claim worth checking: diffed each already-ported file against the
*true* pre-refactor version at the branch's own merge-base with `main`
(`0b88ef561`, not `main`'s current tip — `main` has since gained unrelated
`memory.ts` changes, e.g. a `MemoryEntrySource` field and
`isHeuristicExtractionArtifact`/`pruneProfileBodyToCanonical` helpers, that
post-date `memory-capability-barrel`'s fork point and are simply not present
on that branch; comparing against `main`'s tip would have produced false
"missing" signals unrelated to the actual refactor).

- **`store/store.ts`** vs. `memory.ts` at the merge-base: after stripping
  comment-only lines, the only diff is import-path changes and the
  `memoryEvents`/`MemoryChangeKind`/`MemoryChangeEvent` relocation into
  `core/events.ts` — zero function-body changes. Already fully covered by
  this package's existing `note-store.ts` mechanism-port + the documented
  "not ported" list (type taxonomy, `composeMemoryBody`,
  `listActiveRuleEntries`, onboarding capture, heuristic regex pack,
  `maskMemoryExtractionConfig`/config-override fields).
- **`extractions/extractions.ts`** vs. `memory-extractions.ts` at the
  merge-base: the only diff, stripped of comments, is the single
  `memoryEvents` import path. Already fully covered — this package's
  `extraction-log.ts` is a full port.
- **`verify/verify.ts`** vs. `memory-verify.ts` at the merge-base: same —
  only the `memoryEvents` import path differs. Already fully covered —
  this package's `verify.ts` is a full port (pure algorithm + record log).
- **`connectors/connectors.ts`**, **`llm/llm.ts`**: re-read in full on the
  barrel branch; still OD-branded throughout (`OpenDesign`/`Open Design`
  literal strings in system prompts and comments still present, e.g.
  `connectors/connectors.ts`'s `CONNECTOR_MEMORY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and its
  design-topic regex list). Confirms the original NOT-ported verdicts.
  `llm/llm.ts`'s `callAnthropic`/`callOpenAI`/`callAzure`/`callGoogle` remain
  private (non-exported) helpers entangled with `pickProvider`'s
  agent-CLI-selection logic — not independently extractable without a larger
  refactor than this reconciliation pass's scope, confirming the original
  "not cleanly separable" verdict.

**One genuinely new, generic, OD-noun-free piece found and ported:**
`rules/rules.ts`'s exported `parseRuleBody` function (`git grep parseRuleBody`
on the branch shows it exported from the domain root barrel alongside
`distillRulesFromAnnotations`). It parses a rule note body's labeled lines
(`Assertion:`/`Check:`/`Verified by:`/`Rationale:`) into
`{ assertion, check, rationale }` — pure text parsing, zero product nouns,
and — unlike the rest of `rules.ts` — has no call-site coupling to
`suggestWithLLM`, annotations, or any OD type. The original pass's verdict on
`memory-rules.ts` ("thin wrapper entirely dependent on the skipped
`memory-llm.ts`") was about `distillRulesFromAnnotations`, the file's other
export; it did not separately call out `parseRuleBody`, which turns out to be
a standalone leaf with no such dependency. It also has a direct, motivated
integration point already ported in this package: `verify.ts`'s
`ActiveRuleForVerify.check` is a host-supplied field with no built-in way to
derive it from a stored rule entry's raw body — `parseRuleBody` is exactly
that derivation. Ported as `src/rule-body.ts` (`parseRuleBody`,
`ParsedRuleBody`), re-exported from `index.ts`, tests in
`__tests__/rule-body.test.ts`, 100% coverage on all 4 metrics.

No other new generic pieces were found. `memory-connectors.ts`/`memory-llm.ts`/
`memory-rules.ts`'s remaining exports stay un-ported for the same reasons
recorded in the classification table above; nothing in the barrel's
structural move surfaced content the original `refactor/web-memory-slice`-based
read had missed, beyond `parseRuleBody`.

## 2026-07-21 addition — `llm-provider.ts` (the `memory-llm.ts` concern-(1) carve-out, `feat/http-routes-and-cli-commands`)

Picked up the classification table's own flag on `memory-llm.ts`: concern (1),
"a genuinely generic 'call one of N LLM HTTP APIs with a system+user prompt,
parse strict JSON' sub-pattern... a real future extraction candidate, noted
here for whoever picks this up next." Re-verified against
`leonaburime-ucla/open-design`, branch `refactor/web-memory-slice`, via
`git show refactor/web-memory-slice:apps/daemon/src/memory-llm.ts` (1391
lines) — read in full again rather than trusting the earlier pass's summary,
per this task's own brief that the three concerns are "intertwined," not
cleanly pre-separated. That re-read confirms the earlier verdict on concerns
(2)/(3) and confirms concern (1) genuinely does separate out cleanly once the
provider-object shape is generalized from OD's `pickProvider`-constructed
object (which carries OD-only fields like `credentialSource`/`transport`/
`agentId`) down to just what the four HTTP-call functions themselves
actually read (`baseUrl`/`apiKey`/`model`/`apiVersion`). The barrel-branch
reconciliation note directly above, which called these four functions "not
independently extractable without a larger refactor," was evaluated against
a narrower bar (extracting them with zero refactor, from inside
`pickProvider`'s closure); extracting them as a new caller-configured module
instead of trying to lift them in place is exactly that refactor, and turned
out to be straightforward — the four functions never actually touch any
OD-specific state themselves, only the shape of the object handed to them.

| Jini file | Origin file:line (`refactor/web-memory-slice`) | Transform |
|---|---|---|
| `src/llm-provider.ts` | `callAnthropic` L681-708, `callOpenAI` L710-745, `callAzure` L752-784, `callGoogle` L791-819, plus the shared `appendVersionedApiPath` L614-621, `withTimeout` L626-633, `describeFetchError` L646-679 plumbing, and the fence-stripping/parse-with-fallback half of `parseEntries` L1011-1029 (stops short of L1030's `entries`/`MEMORY_TYPES` schema validation) | See below — generalized, not lifted verbatim; every origin option that was a fixed OD choice (which model, which vendor, when to fall back) became caller-supplied, and every option that was a real HTTP-call parameter (`baseUrl`/`apiKey`/`model`/`apiVersion`/headers/timeout) became a field on the new `LlmProviderConfig`. |

**What was ported, precisely.** `callLlmProvider(config: LlmProviderConfig, systemPrompt, userPrompt): Promise<string>` dispatches on `config.provider` (`'anthropic' | 'openai' | 'azure' | 'google'`) to one of four internal functions that are a direct behavioral port of the origin's `callAnthropic`/`callOpenAI`/`callAzure`/`callGoogle` — same URLs, same headers, same request bodies, same response-field extraction (`content[].find(type==='text').text` for anthropic, `choices[0].message.content` for openai/azure, `candidates[0].content.parts[].text` joined for google), same `response_format: 'json_object'` / `responseMimeType: 'application/json'` strict-JSON-forcing per vendor. `appendVersionedApiPath` (anthropic/openai's `/v1/<resource>` URL-building, avoiding a doubled `/v1/v1/...` against a proxy whose saved base URL already has a version segment) and `describeFetchError` (unwrapping undici's generic `TypeError: fetch failed` down to the OS error code/inner cause) are both ported near-verbatim as exported utilities, with the same branch behavior (including the AggregateError inner-errors fallback loop). `parseStrictJson<T>(rawText): T` ports `parseEntries`'s fence-stripping-then-`JSON.parse`-with-`{...}`-block-fallback mechanics — but stops exactly where that function's memory-specific schema validation begins (`Array.isArray(parsed?.entries)` and the `MEMORY_TYPES` filter), throwing instead of that function's `return []` so a generic caller gets an explicit, catchable failure rather than a silently-empty result that only made sense in the entries-list context. `callLlmProviderForJson<T>` is a new (not in the origin) one-call convenience wrapping the two.

**What was NOT ported — the other two-thirds, unchanged from the original verdict:**
- **Provider auto-selection** (`pickProvider`, `PROVIDER_DEFAULTS`, `envKeyFor`, `chatProtocolFromAgentId`, `canUseLocalCliForMemory`, `localCliProviderFor`) — the 0-through-7 fallback chain (memory-config override → local CLI → chat-protocol env var → BYOK chat-config snapshot → legacy env fallbacks → media-config OpenAI key borrow → skip) is entirely OD product policy about *which* vendor/model/credential to prefer and why, encoding OD-specific concepts (`chatAgentId`, "Same as chat," a memory `.config.json` extraction override, media-config credential borrowing) that have no engine-level meaning. A `Jini` host supplies a fully-resolved `LlmProviderConfig` directly; deciding how to arrive at one is 100% host policy.
- **The two OD-branded system prompts** (`SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `ANNOTATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) — "You are a memory extractor for a personal AI design assistant" / "You are a memory distiller for a personal AI design assistant," plus their `entries[].type` taxonomy tied to OD's `MEMORY_TYPES` (`user`/`feedback`/`project`/`reference`/`rule`). A caller of `callLlmProvider`/`callLlmProviderForJson` supplies its own system prompt string outright — this module has zero prompt content of its own.
- **The `entries`/`MEMORY_TYPES` schema validation** inside `parseEntries` (L1030-1046) — filtering an array of candidate objects against OD's fixed type enum, capping at 6, is memory-domain schema, not a JSON-parsing mechanism. A caller of `parseStrictJson<T>` validates its own shape.
- **The memory-config provider-override resolution** (`readMemoryConfig(dataDir).extraction`, the `.config.json` override shape with `provider`/`model`/`baseUrl`/`apiKey`/`apiVersion`) — an OD persistence/settings-UI concern layered on top of `pickProvider`, not a call-time HTTP concern.
- **Local coding-agent-CLI execution** (`callLocalCli`, `canUseLocalCliForMemory`, `LOCAL_CLI_TIMEOUT_MS`, the `claude`/`codex`/`opencode` one-shot subprocess spawning via `@open-design/platform`'s `createCommandInvocation`, `extractJsonEventText`/`createJsonEventStreamHandler` event-stream parsing) — this is "run one of OD's supported coding CLIs headlessly and scrape its stdout," a completely different transport (local subprocess, not an HTTP API) with no relationship to calling a vendor's REST endpoint. Confirmed again on this re-read: none of it is reachable from, or needed by, the four HTTP-call functions.
- **Everything downstream of a raw/parsed LLM response** — `collectProposedEntries`'s dedup-by-turn-signature, `alreadyKnown`/`toMemoryDraft`, `suggestWithLLM`/`extractWithLLM`/`distillAnnotationsToMemory`, the extraction-attempt-log wiring (`startExtraction`/`markProvider`/`markSuccess`/etc., already ported separately as `src/extraction-log.ts`) — all memory-domain orchestration, out of scope for a "call an LLM, get JSON back" primitive.

**Design decisions beyond straight translation:**
- **Per-vendor default `baseUrl`s kept, but only the three with a real public host.** `anthropic`/`openai`/`google` default to that vendor's actual public API host when `baseUrl` is omitted (the same three URLs the origin's `PROVIDER_DEFAULTS` hardcoded) — this isn't an OD opinion, it's just "what `api.anthropic.com` is." `azure` has no public host (every tenant has its own `<resource>.openai.azure.com`) and throws a clear error if `baseUrl` is omitted, matching the origin's own "Azure with no resource URL is unrecoverable" guard.
- **No default `model`.** The origin's `PROVIDER_DEFAULTS` also picked a default *model* per vendor (`claude-haiku-4-5`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gemini-3.5-flash`) — that's a product cost/quality tradeoff, not an HTTP-call detail, so it was deliberately dropped; `model` is always caller-required here.
- **`extraHeaders` generalizes the origin's single hardcoded AIHubMix special case.** `callOpenAI` had one `provider.kind === 'aihubmix' ? {'APP-Code': AIHUBMIX_APP_CODE} : {}` branch, wiring one specific OD-integrated gateway's attribution header directly into the shared function. Generalized into a caller-supplied `extraHeaders?: Record<string,string>` merged under (never over) this module's own auth/content-type headers — any gateway/proxy attribution header a host wants, without this module knowing any vendor names beyond the four core wire shapes.
- **`AZURE_DEFAULT_API_VERSION` kept as an engineering default, not treated as an OD opinion to strip.** Mirrors `packages/media/src/dispatch/openai-compatible.ts`'s existing `AZURE_DEFAULT_API_VERSION` precedent in this same repo (a different constant value, `2024-02-01`, for a different Azure surface) — an Azure API-version string is a wire-protocol detail every Azure OpenAI-compatible caller needs, not a product choice about which model to prefer.
- **`max_tokens: 1024` (anthropic) kept as an internal constant, not surfaced as a new config option.** The origin hardcoded it rather than exposing it as configurable; surfacing it as caller-configurable would be new API surface the origin never had, not a generalization of something that already varied.
- **The success/error JSON-parsing path was consolidated into one shared `postJson` helper** used by all four vendor calls (the origin repeated near-identical fetch/status-check/`resp.json()` blocks four times) — same behavioral contract (non-2xx → `Error('<tag> <status>: <body>')`, non-JSON 2xx body → `Error('<tag> non-JSON response: <body>')`, matching this repo's existing `parseOpenAICompatibleJson` pattern in `packages/media/src/dispatch/openai-compatible.ts`), not a capability change — DRY between vendors, not a behavior cut.

Tests: `src/__tests__/llm-provider.test.ts` — 56 tests, **100% coverage on all 4 metrics** (statements/branches/functions/lines) on `llm-provider.ts`, covering: every vendor's URL/header/body construction and default-vs-custom `baseUrl`/`apiVersion`, the `appendVersionedApiPath` doubled-`/v1` guard in both directions, every `describeFetchError` branch (plain message, non-Error throw, null/non-object/empty-object cause, code-only, message-only, duplicate-of-head message, code-contains-message-dedup vs. code+message-both-shown, the `AggregateError`-style `errors[]` fallback loop finding a candidate on a later entry vs. exhausting with none vs. a non-array `errors` field), every `parseStrictJson` branch (direct parse, non-object JSON values, both fence styles, regex-fallback success, regex-fallback-found-but-still-invalid, no-braces-at-all, truncated vs. untruncated error previews), config validation (empty/whitespace `apiKey`/`model`, azure-without-`baseUrl`, an unrecognized provider id via a type-bypassing cast — a defensive runtime guard exercised deliberately since this package ships plain JS too), `extraHeaders` unable to clobber required auth headers, `requestInit` passthrough with explicit fields still winning, `timeoutMs` default/custom/`NaN`/non-positive resolution (verified via `vi.spyOn(AbortSignal, 'timeout')`, matching this repo's established real-fetch-mock testing style rather than asserting on internal state), a network-level fetch rejection routed through `describeFetchError`, an empty-200-body response, and both `callLlmProviderForJson` success and JSON-parse-failure propagation.

Dependencies: none beyond Node/web-standard builtins already available in this package's runtime target (global `fetch`, `Response`, `URL`, `AbortSignal.timeout` — Node `~24` per the repo's `engines` field, matching the precedent already set by `packages/media`'s provider files calling `AbortSignal.timeout` directly with no polyfill).

## 2026-07-21 addition — `extract-facts.ts`, the generic extraction pipeline `llm-provider.ts` was ported to support

Closes the gap the `llm-provider.ts` addition above flagged implicitly: that
module is only the "call an LLM HTTP API, get strict JSON back" primitive —
it was never itself an extraction pipeline. This addition is that pipeline:
`extractFacts(llmConfig, { content, sourceLabel? }, options?)` calls
`callLlmProvider` with a generic extraction-shaped system+user prompt, then
`parseStrictJson` + sanitizes/validates the model's response into
`ExtractedFact[]` (`{ statement, category?, entities?, confidence?,
sourceQuote? }`).

**Why this is safe to build now, unlike the pieces still left un-ported.**
Re-read this package's own classification table above before writing any
code, specifically to re-confirm which of the origin's un-ported pieces this
new work must NOT reintroduce, and why each was excluded in the first place:

- **`memory-connectors.ts` (NOT ported: OD-branded connector-mining)** — its
  exclusion reason was "there is no generic 'connector fact-mining'
  mechanism left over once the design-topic filtering and OD branding are
  removed — the whole file *is* that filtering." `extract-facts.ts` has no
  topic filter of any kind — every piece of `content` a caller hands it is
  extracted from as given, with no "is this design-relevant?" gate. Nothing
  from that file was reused or reintroduced.
- **`memory-llm.ts` concerns (2)/(3) (NOT ported: OD system prompts +
  coding-agent-CLI transport)** — concern (2) was OD's product copy
  ("personal AI design assistant") tied to a fixed `MEMORY_TYPES` taxonomy;
  concern (3) was local subprocess execution, a different transport
  entirely. `extract-facts.ts`'s `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` names no
  product/assistant identity and has no fixed category enum
  (`ExtractedFact.category` is a free-form string; the model chooses it,
  optionally steered by a caller-supplied `suggestedCategories` *hint*,
  never an enforced/rejecting filter) — and it only ever calls
  `callLlmProvider`, the HTTP-only primitive concern (1) already ported.
  Concerns (2)/(3) stay un-ported, unchanged.
- **`memory-rules.ts` (NOT ported: thin wrapper over the skipped LLM
  concerns)** — irrelevant here; this addition has no relationship to rule
  distillation.
- **`memory.ts`'s dropped pieces** (`MEMORY_TYPES` taxonomy,
  `composeMemoryBody`, the heuristic regex pack, `maskMemoryExtractionConfig`)
  — none reused. In particular, no fixed type taxonomy was reintroduced:
  {@link factToNoteDraft} (see below) takes `type` as a caller-supplied
  parameter, exactly matching `note-store.ts`'s own already-established
  `NoteStoreConfig.validTypes`/`defaultType` host-supplied-taxonomy
  pattern — this module derives `type` from nothing of its own.

**What was built, precisely** (`packages/memory/src/extract-facts.ts`, no
OD origin — new work assembled from the already-ported `llm-provider.ts`
primitives, same category of "new design work" as `packages/deploy/src/
tool.ts` was for its own package):

- `extractFacts(llmConfig, input, options?)` — the pipeline itself. Empty/
  whitespace-only `input.content` short-circuits to `{ facts: [], raw: '' }`
  with no network call. Builds a user prompt folding in `input.sourceLabel`
  (free text, never a taxonomy value) and `options.prompt.suggestedCategories`
  (a hint), calls `callLlmProvider` with `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (or a
  caller override via `options.prompt.systemPrompt`), then
  `parseStrictJson`s the response and sanitizes each candidate: drops any
  candidate with no usable `statement`, drops non-string `entities` and
  omits an empty `entities` array entirely, clamps `confidence` to `[0, 1]`
  and drops it if non-numeric, trims/drops empty `category`/`sourceQuote`,
  and caps the result at `options.prompt.maxFacts` (default
  `DEFAULT_MAX_FACTS = 20`, matching the same order of magnitude as the
  origin's own cap of 6 for a narrower single-turn case, scaled up for a
  potentially longer document/conversation excerpt — not copied from the
  origin, which this module has no schema/behavior tie to).
- **Optional `ExtractionLog` integration** (`options.logging: { log, kind }`)
  — when supplied, records `startExtraction` → `markProvider` →
  `markProposed` → `markSuccess`/`markFailed` through the already-ported
  `extraction-log.ts`, reusing it rather than inventing a second attempt-log
  shape. Documented explicitly (in both the option's JSDoc and an inline
  comment at the call site) that "success" here means "the extraction call
  itself succeeded," not "facts were persisted" — this module never writes
  to any store, so `markSuccess`'s `writtenCount`/`writtenIds` fields
  reflect facts *extracted*, with `writtenIds` always `[]`; a caller that
  goes on to actually persist some of the returned facts may call
  `log.markSuccess(attemptId, ...)` again with the real outcome, since
  `ExtractionLog` records are mutable/overwritable by id, not append-only.
- `factToNoteDraft(fact, type)` — a small, deliberately optional bridge to
  `note-store.ts`'s `NoteStore.upsertEntry({ name, description, type })`
  input shape, NOT a requirement for using `extractFacts`. Truncates a long
  `statement` to 80 chars for `name` (note-store names are short labels, not
  bodies), keeps the full `statement` (plus a `Source: "..."` line when
  `sourceQuote` is present) as `description`, and takes `type` as a plain
  caller-supplied parameter with no validation against any particular
  store's `validTypes` — the taxonomy is 100% the caller's, matching
  `note-store.ts`'s own already-generalized design.

**What was deliberately NOT built:** any automatic wiring from
`extractFacts`'s output into `note-store.ts` (no "extract and write" combined
function) — persistence is a policy decision (which facts to keep, under
which type, deduping against existing entries) squarely in the "caller
decision" territory this package's whole `note-store.ts` port already drew
that line around; a fixed/default category taxonomy; any topic/relevance
filter; any provider-selection policy (still the host's job via `llmConfig`,
per `llm-provider.ts`'s own already-established boundary).

**Tests:** `src/__tests__/extract-facts.test.ts`, 19 tests, **100% coverage
on all 4 metrics** on `extract-facts.ts` — empty-content short-circuit with
no network call; default-prompt call shape (system prompt, user-prompt
content/maxFacts framing); `sourceLabel`/`suggestedCategories` folded into
the prompt; full system-prompt override; every sanitize-per-candidate branch
(missing/blank statement, non-object candidate, non-string/blank entities,
empty entities array omitted entirely, confidence clamped high/low/non-
numeric, category/sourceQuote trimmed-or-omitted); non-array `facts` field
treated as zero facts; default `maxFacts` cap (20) and a caller-supplied cap
including the floor/non-positive-value fallback branches; network/HTTP-error
and invalid-JSON-response propagation (both unchanged from what
`callLlmProvider`/`parseStrictJson` themselves throw); the full
`ExtractionLog` integration (start→provider→proposed→success on success,
failed-attempt recording on both an LLM-call error and a JSON-parse error,
and "no log passed" leaving nothing to break); and `factToNoteDraft`'s
short/long/with-quote formatting branches.

**Verification:** `pnpm --dir packages/memory exec vitest run --coverage` —
204/204 tests pass; `extract-facts.ts` itself is 100/100/100/100
(statements/branches/functions/lines). Package-wide aggregate is
98.96/98.95/100/98.96, which does **not** clear this package's configured
99% global threshold (`packages/memory/vitest.config.ts`) — but this is a
**pre-existing** shortfall, not something this addition introduced: verified
by stashing this change and re-running coverage against the unmodified tree,
which already failed the same gate at 98.86/98.79/100/98.86 (the gap is
entirely `note-store.ts`'s own pre-existing uncovered lines 204-207/253-255,
untouched by this task and out of this task's scope — item 1 was scoped to
building the extraction pipeline, not auditing `note-store.ts`). Adding this
addition's fully-covered code *improved* the aggregate (98.86 → 98.96 stmts/
lines, 98.79 → 98.95 branches) rather than regressing it. `pnpm --dir
packages/memory exec tsc --noEmit` clean.

Dependencies: none beyond what `llm-provider.ts`/`extraction-log.ts` already
require (no new package dependency).
