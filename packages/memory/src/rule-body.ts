/**
 * @module rule-body
 *
 * Parses a `rule`-type note body written in the labeled-line convention
 * (`Assertion: … / Check: … / Verified by: …`, or `Rationale: …` in place of
 * `Verified by:`) back into the structured fields a verify pipeline can
 * consume — in particular the `check` text `verify.ts`'s
 * `ActiveRuleForVerify.check` expects a host to supply. Ported from the
 * `memory-capability-barrel` branch's `memory/rules/rules.ts`
 * `parseRuleBody` (see `source-map.md`'s "Barrel branch reconciliation"
 * section) — a standalone, zero-product-noun text parser with no coupling
 * to that file's annotation/LLM distillation machinery, which was not
 * ported (see `source-map.md`).
 *
 * Tolerant by design: a body with no recognized labels falls back to
 * treating its first line as the assertion, since a user may type a rule's
 * body as plain prose instead of following the labeled convention.
