## Note (2026-08-03) — folded into `@jini-ai/chat`

This package was retired as a standalone publish and consolidated (along with `@jini/chat-react`)
into `@jini-ai/chat` as the `./core` subpath — see the `feat(chat): consolidate chat-core +
ui/react/chat into @jini-ai/chat` commit and this file's own current location,
`packages/chat/src/core/source-map.md`. Every `pnpm --filter @jini/chat-core` command below is
historical and will fail today (no such package); use the equivalent `pnpm --filter @jini-ai/chat`
command instead. The provenance/transformation record below predates the fold and is otherwise
left as the historical account of the original extraction.

# `@jini/chat-core` — provenance

Origin: `nexu-io/open-design` (fork `leonaburime-ucla/open-design`), branch `main`,
commit `951fa5f1541c3b7af23ccb07e3e60b294def56b1` (2026-07-12), local reference
clone `/Users/la/Desktop/Programming/OSS-Repos/open-design-agentic`.

Per `ADS-memory/reports/jini-port/extraction-plan.md` §12 C3 and
`ADS-memory/reports/jini-port/recon/r4b-webui-design.md` §1: `@jini/chat-core` is the
framework-free "reusable center" — the generic event/message vocabulary plus
every pure artifact/question-form/tool/todo/transcript parser, so a non-React
host (e.g. a Vue shell) can consume the same logic `@jini/chat-react` will
later wrap in hooks. Re-verified every source file's actual current content
against the recon's claims before lifting (see "Deviations from recon"
below) rather than trusting the line-count/coupling summary blindly.

## File map

| Jini file | Origin file(s) | Transform |
|---|---|---|
| `src/events.ts` | `packages/contracts/src/api/chat.ts` (`PersistedAgentEvent`, lines ~561-624) | Kept the generic variants (`status`, `text`, `thinking`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `usage`, `raw`) as `AgentEvent`. Dropped every OD-specific variant: `conversation_title`, `live_artifact`, `live_artifact_refresh`, `diagnostic`, `plugin_candidate`. Dropped `failureCategory`/`failureDetail` off `status` (they type against OD's `RunFailureCategory`/`RunFailureDetail`, re-exports of the daemon's analytics-shaped failure taxonomy — an OD import, not generic). Added `{ kind: 'ext'; name: string; data: unknown }` (new, per r4b §2) as the escape hatch a host uses to carry the dropped/product-specific kinds through the same envelope. `usage`'s fields are the union of the real source (`durationMs`) and r4b §2's literal target type (`stopReason`) — both kept as optional since r4b's design doc and the actual source disagree on this one field and neither costs anything to keep. |
| `src/messages.ts` | `packages/contracts/src/api/chat.ts` (`ChatMessage` lines ~626-660, `ChatRole`, `CHAT_RUN_STATUSES`/`ChatRunStatus` lines ~310-318, `ChatAttachment` lines ~522-532) | `ChatRunStatus`/`CHAT_RUN_STATUSES` → `RunStatus`/`RUN_STATUSES` (renamed per r4b §1's target name; note this name is reused for a *different*, richer shape by `@jini/protocol`'s own `RunStatus` — see the doc-comment on this type and "Known ambiguity" below). Dropped from `ChatMessage`: `sessionMode` (OD's design/chat/plan modes), `runContext` (`RunContextSelection`, OD), `appliedPluginSnapshot` (OD plugin system), `producedFiles`/`traceObjectFiles`/`preTurnFileNames` (typed `ProjectFile[]`, OD's project-file model), `commentAttachments` (OD canvas-annotation feature), `feedback` (`ChatMessageFeedback`, OD-specific rating taxonomy), `telemetryFinalized` (OD request-only marker). Kept: `id`, `role`, `content`, `agentId`, `agentName`, `events`, `createdAt`, `runId`, `runStatus`, `resumable`, `lastRunEventId`, `startedAt`, `endedAt`, `attachments` — the generic conversational shape. Added `isTerminalRunStatus()` (new, mirrors `@jini/protocol`'s `isTerminalRunState` for the same convenience at this layer). |
| `src/partial-json.ts` | `apps/web/src/runtime/partial-json.ts` (94 lines) | Verbatim except doc-comment wording (no OD nouns existed in the original; only reworded "the `<question-form>` discovery/clarification form" framing slightly for a non-web-specific audience). |
| `src/tool-events.ts` | `apps/web/src/runtime/tool-events.ts` (21 lines) | Verbatim logic; retyped `AgentEvent` import to `./events.js`. |
| `src/tools.ts` | `apps/web/src/runtime/tool-renderers.ts` (124 lines) | Lifted only the pure subset: `ToolStatus`, `ToolRenderProps`, `deriveToolStatus()`, `toRenderProps()`. **Deliberately did NOT port** `ToolRenderer` (the `(props) => ReactNode` type — React-typed), `registerToolRenderer()`, `getToolRenderer()`, `clearToolRenderers()` — the module-scoped renderer *registry* is a presentational, React-facing extension point per the task brief, and belongs to `@jini/chat-react`/`@jini/renderers-react`, not this framework-free package. Re-exports `dedupeToolUsesById` from `./tool-events.js` so the tool-lifecycle surface reads as one module. |
| `src/todos.ts` | `apps/web/src/runtime/todos.ts` (163 lines) | Verbatim logic (parse/derive functions), retyped against local `AgentEvent`/`RunStatus`. Added `latestTodoWriteInput` as an exported alias of `latestTodoWriteInputFromMessages` to match the literal name in the task's target API list — kept the original (more descriptive) name as the primary export too, since `@jini/chat-react` and other call sites benefit from the disambiguation once `latestTodoWriteInputForPinnedCard` exists alongside it. |
| `src/question-form.ts` | `apps/web/src/artifacts/question-form.ts` (738 lines) | Verbatim parsing/formatting logic; import of `parsePartialJson` repointed from `'../runtime/partial-json'` to `'./partial-json.js'`. Added `parseQuestionForm()` as a thin wrapper over `findFirstQuestionForm()` (drops the matched raw-text half) to satisfy the exact name in the target API list — the richer `findFirstQuestionForm`/`parsePartialQuestionForm`/`splitOnQuestionForms` are shipped alongside it, not replaced. |
| `src/artifacts/types.ts` | `apps/web/src/artifacts/types.ts` (60 lines) | Verbatim shapes (`ArtifactKind`, `ArtifactRendererId`, `ArtifactExportKind`, `ArtifactStatus`, `ArtifactManifest`). Every optional field additionally typed `| undefined` (e.g. `status?: ArtifactStatus | undefined`) — required by Jini's stricter root `tsconfig.base.json` (`exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`, which OD's own tsconfig does not set); purely a strictness accommodation, not a shape change. |
| `src/artifacts/markdown-context.ts` | `apps/web/src/artifacts/markdown-context.ts` (139 lines) | Verbatim algorithm (`computeSkipRanges`, `isRealArtifactOpenAt`, `rangeContains`, `FENCE_OPEN_RE`/`FENCE_CLOSE_RE`/`INLINE_CODE_RE`). Marked `@internal` and **not re-exported from the package barrel** — it is an implementation detail shared by `parser.ts`/`strip.ts`, not part of chat-core's public surface (the origin file wasn't in the task's named source list either, but `parser.ts`/`strip.ts` both hard-depend on it, so it had to be lifted too — flagged here as an undocumented transitive dependency the recon's file list didn't call out). |
| `src/artifacts/parser.ts` | `apps/web/src/artifacts/parser.ts` (252 lines) | Verbatim streaming state machine (`createArtifactParser`, `ArtifactEvent`). Added `parseArtifacts(content: string): ArtifactEvent[]` (new) — a one-shot wrapper (`feed` + `flush` over a complete string) to satisfy the literal `parseArtifacts()` name in the target API list, since the real API is a stateful streaming parser, not a single function. |
| `src/artifacts/strip.ts` | `apps/web/src/artifacts/strip.ts` (375 lines) | Verbatim logic for `stripArtifact`, `stripRecoveredHtmlFallbackForDisplay` (name unchanged; only its doc-comment was genericized, see below), `matchPersistedArtifactFile`, `PersistedArtifactFileRef`, `summarizeArtifactsForTranscript`, `splitStreamingArtifact`/`StreamingArtifact`. Doc-comment for the fallback-recovery function dropped a reference to a specific OD onboarding template feature ("Grok Build") and reworded generically as "a fallback shape some models emit" — the *logic* it describes (recovering a bare HTML document/fence reply) is generic; only the comment named a product feature. `artifactTranscriptSummary`'s wording changed "saved to the project file" → "saved to the file" / "grep the project directory" → "grep the workspace directory" (no behavior change, just dropping OD's "project" noun in a user-facing string template). |
| `src/artifacts/validate.ts` | `apps/web/src/artifacts/validate.ts` (204 lines) | Verbatim validation algorithm. One content change: the reserved-path denylist was `.live-artifacts`, `.od`, `.tmp` in the origin (`.od` being OD's own dot-directory convention); shipped here as `.live-artifacts`, `.workspace`, `.tmp` — dropped the OD-specific `.od` segment and substituted a generic `.workspace` placeholder. A host that uses a different reserved-directory name should treat this list as illustrative and is expected to run its own equivalent check with its own path if it needs this guarantee; chat-core does not expose the list as configurable in this task (flagged as a follow-up below, not addressed here to keep this slice's scope bounded). Doc-comment and internal function/regex names renamed from "project" to "workspace" (`RESERVED_PROJECT_PATH_RE` → `RESERVED_WORKSPACE_PATH_RE`, `referencesReservedProjectPath` → `referencesReservedWorkspacePath`, etc.) for the same reason. |
| `src/artifacts/manifest.ts` | `apps/web/src/artifacts/manifest.ts` (189 lines) | Verbatim logic (`createHtmlArtifactManifest`, `serializeArtifactManifest`, `parseArtifactManifest`, `inferLegacyManifest`, `artifactManifestNameFor`). Object-literal construction switched from unconditional field assignment to the same computed values, now typed against the `| undefined`-widened `ArtifactManifest` fields (see `types.ts` entry) to satisfy `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. |
| `src/artifacts/recover.ts` | `apps/web/src/artifacts/recover.ts` (107 lines) | Verbatim logic (`recoverHtmlArtifactFromPrecedingDocument`, `resolvePersistedArtifactHtml`, `recoverStandaloneHtmlDocument`, `recoverHtmlDocumentFromMarkdownFence`). `RecoverHtmlArtifactInput`'s optional fields widened with `| undefined` for the same `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` reason. |
| `src/artifacts/pointer.ts` | `apps/web/src/artifacts/pointer.ts` (81 lines) | Verbatim logic (`resolveHtmlPointerArtifactTarget`). Uses `TextEncoder` (a WHATWG/ECMA-402 global available in both browser and Node runtimes, not a DOM/browser-only API) — not on the forbidden-globals list (`window`/`document`/`fetch`/`EventSource`/`localStorage`/`sessionStorage`/`XMLHttpRequest`/`WebSocket`) and kept as-is. |
| `src/artifacts/index.ts` | *(new — not a 1:1 origin file)* | Barrel for the `artifacts/*` module group, re-exporting `types`/`parser`/`strip`/`validate`/`manifest`/`recover`/`pointer` but deliberately omitting `markdown-context` (internal only). |
| `src/transcript.ts` | `apps/web/src/providers/daemon.ts` (pure slice, lines ~74-260 of 1521; the file's SSE/fetch transport — `streamViaDaemon`, `DaemonStreamHandlers`, everything importing `@open-design/contracts`/`./anthropic`/`./sse` — was **not** touched or ported) | See "Transcript generalization" below for the full accounting of what changed and why; this file needed the most adaptation of anything in this package. |
| `src/agentic/chat-capabilities.ts` | *(new 2026-07-25 — not ported from OD)* | See "Agent-control vocabulary" below. |
| `src/index.ts` | *(new — barrel)* | Re-exports every module above. |

## Agent-control vocabulary (`src/agentic/`) — mostly moved to `@jini/agentic` on 2026-07-26

Added 2026-07-25 as new work (no OD provenance). On 2026-07-26, everything in this folder except
`chat-capabilities.ts` moved to `@jini/agentic` — `capability.ts` (`CapabilityDef`,
`availableCapabilities`), `page-capabilities.ts` (`PAGE_CAPABILITIES`), `element-handles.ts` (the
`data-agent-*` convention), `guards.ts` (`findFieldFillRefusal`/`normalizeAgentLabel`),
`page-driver.ts`/`page-executor.ts` (the `PageDriver` port and its policy gate), and the three
protocol projections (`ag-ui.ts`, `mcp-ui.ts`, `webmcp.ts`). See
`ADS-memory/reports/proposals/PLAN-jini-agentic-extraction-2026-07-26.md` and
`packages/agentic/source-map.md` for the extraction and the full file map.

**What stayed, and why.** `chat-capabilities.ts` — the seven `chat.*` capabilities
(`chat.send_message`, `chat.set_draft`, `chat.select_agent`, `chat.cancel_run`,
`chat.reset_conversation`, `chat.set_working_directory`, `chat.get_state`) — is a genuine chat
product surface, not vocabulary, and this package now depends on `@jini/agentic` for the
`CapabilityDef` type rather than the other way around. This is deliberate: if everything had
moved, the vocabulary/product boundary the extraction exists to create would have been fake. The
original reasons this folder existed at all (below) now describe `@jini/agentic`, not this
package:

1. A server-side host (an HTTP route table, an MCP stdio server) must be able to read the same
   manifest without pulling a browser component graph into its process. `chat-react` has a
   single `.` export that reaches `@jini/ui` → `@excalidraw/excalidraw`, `lexical`, `micromark`.
2. `chat-react` is one framework binding. A Vue or Svelte sibling must read identical
   definitions, or the surfaces drift.

**Vocabulary settled here (pre-2026-07-26, still true):** `tool` stays reserved for the engine's
own `ToolRegistry`/`ToolExecutor` nouns; anything an outside caller asks a *frontend* to do is a
**capability**. The first draft had forked this across four files (`ChatPaneAgentToolDef` next
to `capabilityId`), which is why `chat-react`'s older names still carry `@deprecated`.

**Entry points, updated.** This package's `.` export no longer carries a `./agentic` subpath —
removed in the 2026-07-26 extraction, since the folder now only holds one chat-specific data
module rather than a slice worth publishing separately. An external consumer that wants only the
vocabulary now depends on `@jini/agentic` directly.

**Not here:** how an action reaches a page. That is a transport concern — same-document in a
real site, `postMessage` when a host embeds an untrusted preview in a sandboxed frame. The
verbs are identical either way, which is the point of keeping them transport-free.

## Transcript generalization (`src/transcript.ts`)

The task named `providers/daemon.ts`'s transcript helpers as "pure helpers
only." On closer read, three things in that section were not, in fact,
generic — the recon's "pure helper" framing undersold how much OD product
policy was woven in:

1. **BYOK/OpenCode agent-family scoping was hardcoded.** The origin
   `scopeHistoryToAgent`/`isSameTranscriptAgentFamily` hardcode
   `BYOK_OPENCODE_AGENT_ID = 'byok-opencode'` and a `Set` of OD's specific
   BYOK provider agent ids (`anthropic-api`, `openai-api`, `azure-openai-api`,
   ...). This is OD product routing policy, not generic transcript assembly.
   **Fix:** `buildTranscript()`'s `isSameAgentFamily` is now a caller-supplied
   predicate (`BuildTranscriptOptions.isSameAgentFamily`), defaulting to
   exact-id equality when omitted. A host that wants OD's BYOK-family
   behavior supplies that predicate itself; chat-core ships no opinion on it.
2. **The prior-run context warning scanned for an OD-specific tool's output.**
   `buildPriorRunContextWarning` detected an `agent-browser skills get core`
   dump (a specific OD tool's documentation payload) via `compactInput()`
   and a set of literal substring checks (`'Agent Browser Core'`, `'name:
   core'`). This is OD-tool-specific detection logic, not a generic
   transcript concern. **Fix:** dropped entirely, along with the
   now-unused `compactInput()` helper. The remaining warning (high
   input-token count, large persisted tool results) is generic and was
   kept, with its thresholds made configurable
   (`maxMessageChars`/`largeToolResultChars`/`highInputTokenWarningThreshold`
   options, defaulting to the origin's literal constants: 12,000 / 8,000 /
   200,000).
3. **Product-identity strings in user-visible warning text.** The origin
   literally emits `"Open Design truncated ${n} chars..."` and `"Open Design
   detected ${notes}..."`. Both are hard product-identity strings forbidden
   in `packages/@jini/**`. **Fix:** reworded to `"[truncated ${n} chars from
   this prior message before sending it to the agent. ...]"` and `"Detected
   ${notes}."` — same information, no product name.
4. **`persistedArtifactFilesOf` derived its evidence from OD's
   `ChatMessage.producedFiles: ProjectFile[]`** (`ProjectFile` being an OD
   contract type this package must not depend on, and a field this
   package's `ChatMessage` doesn't carry at all — see `messages.ts`
   deviations above). **Fix:** `buildTranscript()` takes an optional
   `resolvePersistedArtifactFiles?: (message: ChatMessage) =>
   ReadonlyArray<PersistedArtifactFileRef>` callback instead, defaulting to
   "nothing persisted" (no summarization) when omitted. A host derives the
   real list from its own file-write bookkeeping and passes it in — the
   same host-injects-the-product-shaped-bit pattern used throughout r4b §2
   (`ProjectContextValue`, slots, etc.).

`latestUserPromptFromHistory` ported verbatim (no OD coupling found).
`sanitizePriorAssistantTurnForTranscript` → `sanitizePriorAssistantTurn`
(renamed, dropping the redundant "ForTranscript" suffix now that it lives in
a module literally called `transcript.ts`); its own logic (stripping an
answered `<question-form>`/`<ask-question>` block and a fenced JSON schema
echo) was generic already and is unchanged, only its `persistedArtifactFiles`
parameter's provenance changed per point 4 above.
`buildDaemonTranscript` → `buildTranscript` (renamed, matching the target
API name and dropping the transport-specific "Daemon" naming — the function
itself never touched the daemon transport).

## Known ambiguity: `RunStatus` name collision with `@jini/protocol`

Per r4b §1/§2's literal target API list, this package exports `RunStatus` as
a flat string union (`'queued' | 'running' | 'succeeded' | 'failed' |
'canceled'`) — the value a `ChatMessage` stamps on itself. `@jini/protocol`
already exports a *different*, richer `RunStatus` (`{ id, state, startedAt?,
endedAt? }`, per its own `src/run.ts`). These are two different types for two
different layers, in two packages with no dependency edge between them, so
there is no compile-time conflict — but a consumer importing both packages
will need to alias one on import (`import type { RunStatus as
ChatRunStatus } from '@jini/chat-core'`). Not fixed here because the target
API name is explicit in the task brief; flagged for `@jini/chat-react` /
future integration work to resolve with an import alias convention, or for a
future ADR to rename one of the two.

## Not ported / explicitly deferred

- **`ToolRenderer`/`registerToolRenderer`/`getToolRenderer`/`clearToolRenderers`**
  (`apps/web/src/runtime/tool-renderers.ts`) — the React-typed renderer
  registry. Out of scope per the task brief ("NOT the renderer-registry/
  registration mechanism itself"); belongs to a future `@jini/chat-react` or
  `@jini/renderers-react` task.
- **`runtime/chat-events.ts`** (`appendErrorStatusEvent`,
  `removeErrorStatusEvent`, `runFailureFieldsFromError`) — recon listed this
  as a "reusable" event-dedup/derivation file, but on reading it, all three
  functions exist specifically to carry OD's `RunFailureCategory`/
  `RunFailureDetail` daemon failure-classification taxonomy (imported from
  `@open-design/contracts`) onto a `status: 'error'` event. Since r4b §2's
  own target `AgentEvent.status` shape already omits `failureCategory`/
  `failureDetail` (see `events.ts` above), there is nothing generic left in
  this file to port once that OD-specific taxonomy is stripped — porting it
  would mean shipping three functions that manipulate fields this package's
  `AgentEvent` doesn't have. Not ported; a host that wants this behavior can
  build the equivalent one-line "find/replace the last `status:'error'`
  event in an array" helper itself, or it can ride the `ext` event escape
  hatch for its own richer failure-taxonomy event kind.
- **`streamViaDaemon`/`DaemonStreamHandlers`/anything importing
  `@open-design/contracts`, `./anthropic`, or `./sse`** from
  `providers/daemon.ts` — the SSE/fetch transport itself. Explicitly out of
  scope per the task brief; this is `@jini/chat-react`'s (or a dedicated
  transport-port package's) `ChatTransport` territory, not chat-core's.
- **The reserved-workspace-path denylist in `validate.ts` is not made
  configurable in this task** (see that file's row above) — it is a fixed
  three-entry list (`.live-artifacts`, `.workspace`, `.tmp`) with the OD-only
  entry (`.od`) dropped and no replacement mechanism for a host to supply its
  own reserved paths. Flagged as a small follow-up for whichever task next
  touches artifact persistence end-to-end (this package has no persistence
  layer of its own to wire it through yet).

## Dependencies

None beyond the TypeScript standard library, per r4b §1 ("Allowed deps: none
beyond TypeScript stdlib"). No React, no DOM/browser globals, no Node
built-ins, no `@jini/protocol` or any other `@jini/*` package, no OD product
imports. Verified by grep across `packages/chat-core/src/**` for
`window`/`document`/`fetch`/`EventSource`/`localStorage`/`sessionStorage`/
`XMLHttpRequest`/`WebSocket` (bare and `globalThis.`-qualified), `react`
imports, `node:*`/`fs`/`path` imports, `process.*`, and any `@open-design/*`
specifier or `Open Design`/`OD_`/`--od-stamp`/`/tmp/open-design`
product-identity string — all clean (see Programmer handoff report for the
exact commands run).

## Strictness-only edits (Jini's stricter `tsconfig.base.json`, no behavior change)

Jini's root `tsconfig.base.json` sets `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`,
which OD's own tsconfig does not set. This surfaces object-literal
assignments of an explicit `T | undefined` value onto a plain `field?: T`
property (legal without the flag, an error with it). Fixed by widening the
declared optional-field types to `field?: T | undefined` at the six sites
this affected — no logic changed, only the declared type of already-optional
fields:

- `src/artifacts/types.ts`: `ArtifactManifest.status`/`primary`/
  `supportingFiles`/`createdAt`/`updatedAt`/`sourceSkillId`/`designSystemId`/
  `metadata`.
- `src/artifacts/recover.ts`: `RecoverHtmlArtifactInput.identifier`/`sourceText`.
- `src/todos.ts`: `TodoItem.activeForm`.
- `src/question-form.ts`: the three option-lookup helpers
  (`formOptionDisplayForValue`/`formOptionLabelForValue`/
  `formOptionValueForLabel`) took `Pick<FormQuestion, 'options'>` in the
  origin; retyped to an inline `{ options?: FormOption[] | undefined }` so a
  locally-computed `FormOption[] | undefined` variable can be passed as
  `{ options }` without a spread workaround.

## 2026-07-29 — `reattachRun` gained a cancellation seam (`ReattachRunOptions`)

Post-merge audit fix. `ChatTransport.reattachRun(runId, handlers)` returned `Promise<void>` with no
signal, no unsubscribe and no disposer — so a reattached SSE/WebSocket stream had no way to be
detached on unmount, reset or replacement, and kept its connection and read loop alive until the run
ended on its own. The leak was already visible in the shipped hook: `@jini-ai/chat-react`'s
`useRunStream.reattach()` created an `AbortController`, stored it, and aborted it on
unmount/reset/supersession — a controller it had no parameter to hand to the transport. (The hook's
generation counter kept stale callbacks from clobbering state, which is why this read as correct; it
never closed anything.)

Added an optional third parameter, `options?: ReattachRunOptions`, carrying `signal?: AbortSignal` —
the same seam `StartRunInput.signal` already is for `startRun`. Optional and positional-last so every
existing implementation stays type-compatible unedited. `useRunStream` now passes its subscription
signal; `examples/reference-web`'s daemon transport threads it into the fetch that opens the stream.

**Also corrected two stale comments, no behavior change:**

- `agentic/index.ts` claimed `chat-react`'s `agent-tools.ts` shim still names `CapabilityDef` through
  this package. It imports it from `@jini-ai/agentic` directly; the re-export now has no in-repo
  consumer and is documented as a pure external-compatibility alias.
- `chat-capabilities.ts`'s `chat.send_message` carried `surface: 'server'` with the comment "the one
  genuinely headless outcome here". Nothing shipped satisfies it headlessly:
  `@jini-ai/daemon`'s `createFrontendCapabilityRegistrations` — the only projection of this manifest
  into callable tools — routes *every* capability through the frontend session bound to the run, and
  does not read `surface` at all. The declaration is left as-is (it states the intended surface, and
  nothing is advertised differently because of it today), but the comment now names the gap and the
  concrete trap: `@jini-ai/agentic`'s `availableCapabilities(CHAT_CAPABILITIES, false)` returns exactly
  this entry, and every call to it fails with `no frontend is bound`.

Verified: `packages/chat-core` 261/261 passing; `packages/chat-react` 610/610 passing and
100/100/100/100 coverage (2 new `useRunStream` tests pinning that the signal reaches the transport
and fires on supersession, unmount and reset).
