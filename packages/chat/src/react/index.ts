/**
 * @jini-ai/chat-react — headless hooks + presentational components + slots for
 * a chat/artifact frontend, built on `@jini-ai/chat/core`'s framework-free
 * vocabulary. See ADS-memory/reports/jini-port/recon/r4b-webui-design.md §1/§2/§4 for the
 * spec this package implements, and source-map.md for provenance.
 *
 * This barrel is filled in incrementally as each layer lands (hooks first,
 * then presentational components, then the `<JiniChatProvider>` composition
 * root) — see source-map.md's "Status" section for what's shipped so far.
 *
 * ## Every export here is explicit. Do not reintroduce `export *`.
 *
 * This file used 15 `export * from` statements until 2026-08-05. That made the package's public
 * API *implicit*: whatever any of those modules happened to export was public, so renaming an
 * internal helper shipped a breaking change nobody reviewed, and no one could read this file and
 * say what the package exports. It is also the likeliest reason consumers reach past this barrel
 * into `@jini-ai/chat/core` deep paths — a grab-bag invites bypassing.
 *
 * The expansion was mechanical and provably surface-preserving: 193 symbols before and after,
 * identical in name AND in value-vs-type kind. `features/chat-pane/index.ts` is the style model.
 *
 * When adding an export, add the name here deliberately. That edit IS the API review.

// theory in the comment this replaced — "an independent slice... for a consumer that wants
// everything from one barrel" — but that consumer never existed. Checked twice, once before and
// once after the 2026-08-05 BYOK restructure of this directory: zero imports of any of its 27
// symbols anywhere in this monorepo's other packages, Jini's own examples/, or the one real
// external host consuming this package via a `file:` dependency, and zero internal use from
// `ChatPane`'s own composition. Every apparent
// name-collision hit (`AgentDefinition`, `AgentDiagnostic`, `CredentialStatus`, `ModelOption`,
// `ModelProvider`, `matchesModelQuery`) traced back to an unrelated same-named symbol native to
// `@jini-ai/protocol`/`@jini-ai/agent-runtime` or a same-named local helper in `@jini-ai/ui` — not
// this package's re-export. See ADS-memory/reports/refactor/2026-08-05-ref-001-steps-bcd-proposal.md
// §2.4 for the full trace and §9 for the re-confirmation against the post-BYOK tree.
//
// The feature itself is not deleted — `./features/model-picker/index.js` still exists and still
// works for anything inside this package that wants it (nothing currently does). This removes only
// the root barrel's re-export of it. A future consumer that genuinely needs it gets a real ADR-worthy
// decision (its own subpath, most likely, following Step C's pattern) instead of a standing
// "just in case" export nobody asked for.

 * prop-forwarding ternaries — which was itself the finding: a consumer building an equivalent
