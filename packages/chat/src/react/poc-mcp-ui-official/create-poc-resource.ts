/**
 * @module poc-mcp-ui-official/create-poc-resource
 *
 * PROOF OF CONCEPT — NOT wired into the package's public API (not re-exported from
 * `src/react/index.ts`), and NOT a replacement for the hand-rolled MCP-UI stack
 * (`McpUiSurfaceCard.tsx`, `useMcpUiHost`, `create-mcp-ui-tool-caller.ts`), which this file does
 * not touch.
 *
 * Validates that the REAL, official `@mcp-ui/server` package (not this repo's own reimplementation
 * of the MCP-UI resource shape) can build a `UIResource` end to end, per the owner's decision to
 * evaluate replacing the hand-rolled client with the upstream package. See
 * `poc-mcp-ui-official/__tests__/poc-mcp-ui-official.test.tsx` for the assertions this module
 * exists to feed, and `ADS-memory/` (the consuming product's own copy) / this session's final report for the CJS/ESM
 * interop finding that shaped how this is imported (ESM only — `@mcp-ui/client`'s CJS build is
 * broken in 7.1.1; `require('@mcp-ui/client')` throws / returns an empty object depending on Node
 * version. `@mcp-ui/server`'s CJS build works fine in this same version, but this module still
 * uses the ESM entry point for consistency with the client half of this POC).
