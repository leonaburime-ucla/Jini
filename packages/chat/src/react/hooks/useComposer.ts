/**
 * @module useComposer
 *
 * Owns the composer's draft text, staged attachments, `@`-mention popover
 * state, and the selected agent/model/sessionMode. Per
 * `ADS-memory/reports/jini-port/recon/r4b-webui-design.md` §4: attachments reach the host
 * only through `ProjectContextValue.uploadFiles`/`ComposerSlots`; no direct
 * provider import. Draft persistence (OD's `ComposerDraftPort`,
 * localStorage-backed) is likewise injectable, not hard-wired — this hook
 * never touches `localStorage` itself; a host that wants persistence passes
 * `persistence` (falling back to in-memory/no persistence when omitted).
 *
 * Origin pattern: OD's `features/chat-composer/hooks/useComposerDraft.hooks.ts`
 * + `useComposerUpload.hooks.ts` + `useMentionPopover.hooks.ts` (branch
 * `refactor/web-chat-composer-slice-pr`), generalized: the Lexical-editor-ref
 * plumbing and localStorage port are OD/DOM-specific and dropped; the
 * draft/attachment/mention/agent-selection *state shape* is kept.
 *
 * `conversationId` (when supplied) keys the draft — and, on a change, the staged attachments and
 * mention popover — against `composer-draft-cache.ts`'s module-level cache, so a switch between
 * conversations round-trips whatever was typed instead of losing it or leaking it into the wrong
 * conversation. That cache is a separate, always-on mechanism from `persistence` above: `persistence`
 * is a single opaque host-owned slot (e.g. localStorage, for surviving a page *reload*) that this
 * hook still never touches directly; the cache instead survives a `ChatPane` remount within the same
 * page session — see its own module doc for why a switch here so often means a full remount. Staged
 * attachments and the mention popover are deliberately NOT cached across a switch (unlike the draft
 * text): they reference an in-flight upload batch, and carrying them into a different conversation
 * risks attaching the wrong files to the wrong thread, so they are cleared instead.
