/**
 * @module slots
 *
 * The slot/adapter interfaces a host injects into `<JiniChatProvider>` (or
 * passes directly to a headless hook) to supply everything this package
 * deliberately does not own: project/workspace file access, model/agent
 * optional picker overrides, composer extension points, attachment rendering,
 * analytics, and i18n. Every OD-domain widget (OdCard, design-toolbox, brand-browser,
 * plugin folders, sketch preview, comments/annotation, AMR billing,
 * model/agent picker, file preview) is a host concern reached through one of
 * these slots — see `ADS-memory/reports/jini-port/recon/r4b-webui-design.md` §2, which
 * this module implements field-for-field.
 *
 * Only `import type { ReactNode }` is used here (no JSX, no React runtime
 * value import), so this file stays at the package's top level per the
 * react-layout policy in `ADS-memory/reports/jini-port/god-components-extraction-plan.md`
 * — everything that actually renders (hooks, components) lives under
 * `react/`.
