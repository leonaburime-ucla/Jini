/**
 * `JournalEntry` — the byte-journal record shape locked by the run/chat
 * orchestration swarm-consensus debate (gap 1, "the observability floor
 * every later increment depends on" — see
 * `ADS-memory/reports/swarm-consensus/runs/20260722T023000Z-consensus-report.md`'s
 * Final Recommendation). Deliberately a new, minimal vocabulary: no
 * `provenance`/`trust` concept existed anywhere in `@jini/protocol` or
 * `@jini/daemon` before this.
 *
 * `trust` exists for gap 3 (capability-routed transport, not yet built): the
 * debate's Final Recommendation requires "structured/JSON-escaped framing
 * exclusively — never raw string concatenation" when a later increment
 * injects a tool result back into a child agent's input, given the
 * prompt-injection stakes on that exact path. A byte a host itself composed
 * and sent is `'trusted'`; a byte a child agent process produced is
 * `'untrusted'` by definition, since it is attacker-influenceable output the
 * kernel does not control.
