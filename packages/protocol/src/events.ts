   * One MCP content block withheld from a tool result because it is for the HUMAN, not the model.
   *
   * MCP's own model is that a tool result carries content blocks and the *host* decides which of
   * them reach the model and which are rendered for the person: keeping them in one payload is the
   * protocol, separating them is the host's job. This variant is that separation made explicit on
   * the wire. `@jini-ai/daemon`'s `delegated-tool-bridge.ts` splits a result (see
   * `tool-result-surfaces.ts`) and emits one of these per withheld block, then emits the
   * model-visible remainder as the usual `tool_result`.
   *
   * Why it cannot simply stay in the result: a tool call's return value is definitionally what the
   * model receives, and `@jini-ai/mcp`'s `okResult()` JSON.stringifies a whole result into one text
   * block. A confirmation dialog left in the result therefore hands the model the very token the
   * dialog exists to withhold — after which the model can approve its own destructive action with
   * no human involved. Emitting out-of-band is what makes that structurally impossible rather than
   * merely discouraged.
   *
   * `resource` is typed `unknown` for the same reason `a2ui`'s `message` is: `@jini-ai/protocol`
   * sits below every other package in the dependency graph and must not depend sideways on a
   * feature package for one variant's shape. Structural validation happens where the type IS
   * known — `@jini-ai/ui`'s `parseUIResource` on the consuming side. `toolUseId` correlates the
   * surface with the `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair it was split out of.
   *
   * A chat host renders these by calling `@jini-ai/chat`'s `registerMcpUiSurfaceRenderer()` once;
   * this `type` deliberately matches that renderer's `MCP_UI_EXT_EVENT_NAME`.
