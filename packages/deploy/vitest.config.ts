        // one individually proven unreachable via its real call graph and

        // a packages/deploy/source-map.md entry (see the 2026-07-22 addition
        // there for the full per-branch trace). Measured, current, real
        // numbers: 99.78/95.95/100/99.78 (statements/branches/functions/
        // lines) — this is genuine 100% on every *reachable* branch in the
        // package. Thresholds below are set just under those real numbers as
        // a regression gate, not a stretch target — do not lower them, and
        // raise them only alongside genuinely new coverage (never by
        // documenting a branch unreachable without re-deriving the proof
        // yourself, per this repo's standing rule).
