/**
 * `deploy.publish` wired as a real `@jini/core` `Tool` registration — the
 * bridge between `publishDeploy` (`tokens.ts`, still the plain async
 * function that actually dispatches to a bound `DeployTarget`) and the
 * tool-execution boundary (`@jini/core`'s `ToolRegistry` +
 * `@jini/daemon`'s `ToolExecutor`; see `packages/core/src/tool-registry.ts`
 * and `packages/daemon/src/tool-executor.ts`). This file follows the same
 * `{descriptor, handler, policy}` shape `packages/daemon/src/
 * delegated-tool-bridge.ts` established for wiring an existing capability
 * into that boundary — see `source-map.md`'s "2026-07-21 addition" section
 * for the full design rationale, in particular why the default policy below
 * denies every call rather than allowing one.
 *
 * This package does not depend on `@jini/daemon` — a `ToolRegistration` is
 * just data (`@jini/core`'s public shape); only the host composing a daemon
 * needs `ToolExecutor` to actually run it. That keeps `@jini/deploy`'s
 * dependency graph unchanged (still just `@jini/core` + `@jini/platform` +
 * `undici`).

 *
 * Why deny-by-default specifically (not e.g. "allow same-principal-as-run"

 * codebase that reaches real external infrastructure under the caller's own
 * cloud account — a successful call spends the operator's Vercel/Cloudflare
 * quota, publishes content to a public, internet-reachable URL, and (for
 * Cloudflare custom domains) can create real DNS records. Unlike most tool
 * calls, a wrongly-allowed `deploy.publish` is not cheaply reversible and
 * has an externally visible blast radius. That is a strictly stronger case
 * for deny-by-default than `@jini/media`'s `DEFAULT_MEDIA_EXECUTION_POLICY`
 * (SEC-RB-010, `packages/media/src/policy.ts`) — media generation is
 * costly but self-contained; a bad deploy is costly AND publicly visible AND
 * (for custom domains) mutates DNS. Matching this branch's established
 * "deny-by-default" discipline (see commit `0a9c9c237`'s media-policy fix)
