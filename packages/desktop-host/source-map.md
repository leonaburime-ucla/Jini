# `@jini/desktop-host` — provenance

Built ahead of `extraction-plan.md` §3's stated deferral (`# deferred until a 2nd host
exists`) per an explicit human decision, not because a second host consumer is confirmed
yet. Scope was deliberately kept to the C7-recommended narrow slice (shell primitives +
bridge pattern + RenderService port + dual Electron/Tauri adapters) — do not read this
package's existence as license to also port the updater/deck-capture/pdf-export
OD-specific business logic; those remain explicitly out of scope.

Origin: `leonaburime-ucla/open-design`, cloned fresh from `main` for this task (not the
frozen `integrations/open-design/reference/` snapshot — see that directory's README
caveat). Per `docs/jini-port/extraction-plan.md` §12 C7: `RenderService` is "a provider
bound via the registry, not a kernel service" (`renderToPdf(html)->bytes` /
`capture(html)->png` + viewport/timeout/abort/resource-policy, Electron / headless-Chromium
/ Tauri as adapters), and the Tauri spike is scoped narrowly to "sidecar launch/discovery,
URL load, shutdown, crash recovery, single-instance, open-path/open-external — NOT
updaters/deck/parity."

## Package map

| Jini file | Origin file(s) | Transform |
|---|---|---|
| `src/single-instance.ts` | `apps/packaged/src/launch.ts`'s `claimPackagedSingleInstanceLock` | Already generic; renamed, port-ified (`SingleInstanceLockPort` bound to one app handle at construction, consistent with the other bound ports). |
| `src/window-lifecycle.ts` | **Not a port** — see "Discrepancies vs. the task's file list" below | From-scratch minimal port (create/loadUrl/show/hide/focus/close/isDestroyed/onClosed) plus `withMainWindowTracking`, the single-main-window/re-show-on-second-instance bookkeeping every packaged desktop app needs. |
| `src/protocol.ts` | `apps/packaged/src/protocol.ts` (`od://` custom-scheme fetch proxy) | Mechanism lifted, de-branded: scheme/target/error-code all caller-supplied instead of hardcoded `od`/`OD_PROTOCOL_PROXY_FAILED`. |
| `src/sidecar.ts` | `apps/packaged/src/sidecars.ts` (spawn/discover/shutdown mechanics only) | **Not a lift** — generalized from ~620 OD-specific lines (two-sidecar daemon+web model, `@open-design/sidecar-proto` JSON-IPC, PostHog/telemetry env, legacy-migration timeouts) down to a transport-agnostic contract: spawn a child, poll a caller-supplied readiness probe racing the child's exit, shut down via a caller-supplied graceful request with a force-kill fallback. |
| `src/paths.ts` | `apps/packaged/src/paths.ts` | Kept the namespace/base-root/data-dir-override layout *pattern*; dropped every OD-specific field and the hardcoded `OD_DATA_DIR` env var name / "Open Design" error strings. See discrepancies below — this file was far more OD-coupled than expected. |
| `src/config.ts` | `apps/packaged/src/config.ts` | Kept only the explicit-path-env-var-override-falling-back-to-candidate-paths *loading* pattern; dropped all OD product config fields (telemetry, PostHog, AMR profile, daemon/web sidecar entries, web output mode). |
| `src/logging.ts` | `apps/packaged/src/logging.ts` | File logger + console shim + fatal `uncaughtException`/`unhandledRejection` handler-that-detaches-then-rethrows, generalized (caller-supplied log path, no `OD_DESKTOP_LOG_ECHO` env var, no `PackagedNamespacePaths`/`SidecarStamp` coupling). `isHarmlessSocketOptionError` kept as an overridable default predicate. |
| `src/windows-registry.ts` | `apps/packaged/src/windows-lifecycle.ts` | Ported as-is (registry query/write args, platform/version guards); genericized only by injecting `resolveUninstallRegistryKey` instead of importing OD's `@open-design/sidecar-proto` helper. See discrepancies — this file's *name* is misleading. |
| `src/bridge.ts` | `packages/host/src/index.ts` (`window.__od__`/`OpenDesignHostBridge`) | Wire-protocol mechanism (typed-global detection/validation, scope-aware getter, uniform-failure-shape action wrappers) ported; every OD namespace/branding stripped — see "Scope 2" below. |
| `src/bridge-testing.ts` | `packages/host/src/testing.ts` | Same mock-install pattern, retargeted at the smaller de-branded bridge. |
| `src/shell.ts` | *(new — see discrepancies)* | `ShellPort` (`openExternal`/`openPath`), the host-side capability the bridge's `shell` namespace needs behind it. |
| `src/render-service.ts` | *(new, shaped per §12 C7)* | `RenderService` port + `RenderServiceError` + `withRenderTimeout` shared timeout/abort helper. Not a port of `deck-capture.ts`/`pdf-export.ts` — see "Explicitly not ported" below. |
| `src/ports.ts` | *(new)* | `DesktopHostPorts` — the shared port set (`singleInstance`, `windowLifecycle`, `protocolHandler`, `sidecarLauncher`, `renderService`, `shell`) both `create*DesktopHost` factories compose. |
| `src/tokens.ts` | *(new)* | `@jini/core` tokens for each port, per `packages/core/src/token.ts`'s convention, for a future pack/`createDaemon` composition — this package does not itself define a pack. |
| `src/electron/*` | *(new adapters + structural surface types)* | Electron-backed implementation of every `DesktopHostPorts` entry, plus `create-electron-desktop-host.ts`. See "Electron adapter" below. |
| `src/tauri/*` | *(new adapters + structural surface types)* | Tauri-backed implementation of the C7 narrow slice, plus `create-tauri-desktop-host.ts`. See "Tauri adapter" below. |

## Discrepancies vs. the task's file list (found by reading the real source, not assumed)

The task brief listed `apps/packaged/src/{windows-lifecycle,protocol,launch,launcher-runtime,paths,config,logging}.ts` as the scope-1 shell primitives to port, with an instruction to verify each is genuinely generic rather than trust the list. On reading them in full against OD's real `main` branch:

- **`windows-lifecycle.ts` is not window lifecycle.** Despite the name, its entire contents are Windows uninstall-registry `DisplayVersion` sync (`syncWindowsUninstallDisplayVersion`) — an installer/packaging concern, not window/BrowserWindow management. Ported as `windows-registry.ts` for what it actually is.
- **OD's real window/URL-load/single-instance-reveal runtime is not in this file list at all.** It lives in `@open-design/desktop/main` (`createDesktopRuntime`/`runDesktopMain`/`createSplashWindow`), an unlisted, unread, much larger package (update-flow, window-title, splash, tray) explicitly out of this task's scope. `window-lifecycle.ts` here is therefore a from-scratch minimal port sized to what C7's narrow slice needs (create/load/show/close/track-as-main-window), not a lift.
- **`launcher-runtime.ts` is OD's self-update multi-version launcher**, built on `@open-design/launcher-proto` (payload manifests, channel/version reconciliation, install/attempt/cleanup descriptors) — this is updater-adjacent machinery, the same family as the explicitly-excluded `apps/desktop/src/main/updater.ts`, not a generic shell primitive. **Not ported.**
- **`paths.ts` was far more OD-coupled than expected**: hardcoded `OD_DATA_DIR` env var name, "Open Design"-branded error strings, and OD-specific fields (`desktopIdentityPath`, `headlessIdentityPath`, `webIdentityPath`, `installerObservationRoot`, `updateRoot`, PostHog-adjacent `installationRoot`). Only the base-root/namespace/data-dir-override *pattern* was kept; the env var name is now caller-supplied and every OD-specific field dropped.
- **`config.ts` was almost entirely OD product config** (telemetry relay URL, PostHog key/host, AMR profile, daemon/web sidecar entry paths, web output mode) — none of it a shell primitive. Only the load-order mechanism survived.
- **The real "sidecar launch/discovery" primitive C7 asks for is in `sidecars.ts`, which the task's file list did not name.** `launcher-runtime.ts` (which *was* named) is not it. `sidecar.ts` here is generalized from `sidecars.ts`.
- **`ShellPort` (`src/shell.ts`) was missing from the task's scope-1 list entirely**, even though C7's narrow slice explicitly names "open-path/open-external" and the bridge's `shell` namespace (scope 2) needs a host-side implementation behind it. Added during scope 4 once the gap became apparent wiring the Tauri adapter against the same `DesktopHostPorts` shape scope 3 established, with an Electron implementation added retroactively alongside it.

## Scope 2 — bridge de-branding (`packages/host` → `src/bridge.ts`)

OD's `packages/host` is 2 files (`index.ts` 674 lines, `testing.ts` 141 lines — not the "6 files, ~1030 LOC" the task brief estimated; the brief's count does not match the real repo, noted here rather than silently reconciled). Ported the MECHANISM only:

- `window.__od__` → `window.__jini__`; `OPEN_DESIGN_HOST_VERSION` (2) → `JINI_HOST_VERSION` (1, a new protocol, not OD's — no compatibility to preserve).
- Dropped entirely: `browser`, `capture`, `pdf`, `pet`, `project` namespaces (project import/replace-working-dir, deck PDF print, capture-page, the desktop pet, browser-data clearing) — all OD design/product concepts. `capture`/`pdf` *rendering* capability is not a renderer-bridge concern at all in this package — see `render-service.ts`, which is a host/daemon-process-side provider, not something reached via `window.__jini__`.
- `client.type`: OD's hardcoded `'desktop'` → `'electron' | 'tauri'` (this package's two real backends).
- `shell.openPath`: OD's `projectId` (resolved to a path OD-side before crossing the bridge) → a raw path string (a generic host has no project concept to resolve from).
- `updater`: kept only as an optional, **unimplemented** extension point (`checkAvailability`) — no adapter in this package implements real update-checking business logic, per the explicit exclusion of OD's `updater.ts`. Validation does not require a host to provide it.

## Scope 3 — RenderService + Electron adapter

`src/render-service.ts` defines the port exactly per C7's shape (`renderToPdf`/`capture`/`exportArtifact`, each taking viewport/timeoutMs/`AbortSignal`/resourcePolicy). `src/electron/electron-render-service.ts` implements it by loading the given HTML into a hidden `BrowserWindow` (via a base64 `data:` URL) and calling Electron's own `webContents.printToPDF`/`capturePage` — no PDF/PNG rendering is reimplemented. Default resource policy blocks navigation away from the render document and can allowlist origins for outbound requests during the render. `exportArtifact` throws `RenderServiceError` (`not-implemented`) in the Electron adapter too — no artifact format beyond PDF/PNG was in scope.

**Not ported**: OD's `deck-capture.ts`/`pdf-export.ts` (design/slide-specific business logic — layout composition, deck pagination, OD's project model). Those stay OD-side as a future adapter implementing this *same* `RenderService` port with OD's behavior layered on top.

## Scope 4 — Tauri adapter (narrow spike)

Implements the C7-named slice only, against structural (non-`@tauri-apps/*`-dependent) surface types in `tauri-surfaces.ts`:

- **Single-instance** (`tauri-single-instance.ts`): fundamentally different from Electron's model. Tauri's `tauri-plugin-single-instance` enforces the lock in Rust *before* this instance's JS runtime starts; there is no JS-callable "try to acquire" call. `claim()` only registers the "a second launch was attempted" listener and always returns `true` (by the time this JS runs, the lock question is already settled).
- **Window lifecycle / URL load** (`tauri-window-lifecycle.ts`): via a `TauriWindowLike.navigate(url)` structural method (Tauri v2's real webview API).
- **Sidecar launch/discovery/shutdown/crash-recovery** (`tauri-sidecar.ts`): reimplemented against a `TauriSidecarCommandApi`/`TauriChildProcessLike` surface rather than sharing `../sidecar.ts`'s `node:child_process`-based implementation — a real Tauri webview has no direct Node process-spawning access; sidecars are launched through the shell plugin's allowlisted `Command.sidecar` mechanism. Same ready/shutdown algorithm, different process handle shape underneath.
- **open-path/open-external** (`tauri-shell.ts`): via a `TauriShellApi` (`openUrl`/`openPath`, matching `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener`'s real shape).

**Explicitly stubbed, not faked** (per the task brief's instruction to mark clearly rather than pretend):

- **`RenderService`** (`tauri-render-service.ts`): every method throws `NotImplementedError`. Tauri has no JS-reachable equivalent of `webContents.printToPDF`/`capturePage` — a real implementation means driving native rendering from the Rust side, real follow-up work beyond a spike.
- **`ProtocolHandlerPort`** (`tauri-protocol.ts`): throws `NotImplementedError`. Custom-scheme registration in Tauri is a Rust/`tauri.conf.json`-time concern with no JS-callable equivalent, and C7's narrow slice does not name protocol handling for Tauri at all (only "URL load", which the window-lifecycle adapter already covers via `navigate`).

`create-tauri-desktop-host.ts` composes the identical `DesktopHostPorts` shape `create-electron-desktop-host.ts` does — this is the actual proof the adapter-split architecture holds for a second real backend, which is the whole point of doing the split now instead of Electron-only first.

## Explicitly not ported (stays OD-side)

Per the task brief's DO-NOT-PORT list, none of the following were read beyond confirming their existence/purpose from directory listings and the recon docs already in this repo:

- `apps/desktop/src/main/updater.ts` (~3,529 lines, OD release-channel-specific) and `launcher-runtime.ts`/`@open-design/launcher-proto` (the same update-flow family, see discrepancies above).
- `deck-capture.ts`/`pdf-export.ts` (OD design-export business logic — a future `RenderService` adapter, not this task).
- `apps/packaged/src/{identity,download-attribution,startup-telemetry,launcher-after-quit}.ts` (OD branding/analytics-specific).
- OD's `@open-design/launcher-proto` package (desktop-packaging glue, not engine material per `docs/jini-port/recon/r2-packages.md`).

## Vocabulary / boundary notes

- No `Open Design`/`OD_`/`--od-stamp`/`/tmp/open-design` strings anywhere in `src/**` runtime code — the only "OD"/`__od__` mentions are provenance comments describing what was de-branded (same convention as `packages/daemon/src/*.ts`/`packages/deploy/source-map.md`), never runtime identifiers. Confirmed by `grep -rn "__od__" src/` returning only comment lines (see the Programmer handoff's guard-run output).
- `window.__jini__` bridge global fully replaces `window.__od__` — zero remaining references outside prose.
- Electron and Tauri are structural dependencies only: this package does not depend on the real `electron` or `@tauri-apps/*` npm packages (no binary download, no native module). Adapters take injected surfaces matching narrow structural interfaces (`electron-surfaces.ts`/`tauri-surfaces.ts`); a real host passes its real `app`/`BrowserWindow`/`protocol`/`shell` modules (a structural superset) or the real Tauri plugin functions. Tests use fakes of those same interfaces (`electron/testing.ts`, `tauri/testing.ts`).
