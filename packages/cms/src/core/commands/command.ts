/**
 * @file The single mutation write path.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Every admin mutation — human save or AI tool call — runs through
 * `executeCommand`, which captures the inverse, executes the feature call, and
 * records an auto-applied single-item change set. Audit trail by construction.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * - Wraps `features/*` mutation functions; never contains domain logic itself.
 * - Persists via `ChangeSetRepoPort`; announces via the outbox when provided.
 * - `revert.ts` consumes the recorded inverse payloads to undo change sets.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * The gate that makes "auditable and undoable" a property of the system rather
 * than a per-feature effort. Proposed (unapplied) multi-item change sets for
 * agent plans build on this same envelope later.
