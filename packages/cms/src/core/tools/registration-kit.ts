/**
 * @file The cross-domain half of the agent-tool wiring split: everything a domain's own
 * `tool-registrations.ts` needs that is NOT specific to that domain.
 *
 * Why this file exists at all. Every domain's wiring repeats the same five moves — index its
 * catalog by id, read a handful of fields off `ctx.input`, run the tool's permission check,
 * decorate a shape rejection with the published schema, and then loop the handler map into
 * `ToolRegistration`s behind a build-time risk/schema gate. Those five moves were previously copied
 * per domain inside one shared `assistant/tool-registrations.ts`, which is exactly why that file
 * grew past 2000 lines and why three independent domain slices could not be developed in parallel
 * without colliding on it. Each domain now owns a `tool-registrations.ts` next to its own code and
 * imports the shared moves from here; `assistant/tool-registrations.ts` is reduced to the
 * aggregator that assembles them.
 *
 * The membership test for anything in this file is "would a fourth, not-yet-written domain need
 * it?". Domain-shaped things deliberately stay out: each domain's model-facing `to*View`
 * projections, its dependency-bag builder, its own `DERIVED_RISK_BY_TOOL_ID` slice (a claim about
 * that domain's handlers, so it is maintained where those handlers live), and its unwired-tool set.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT abstracted here is the authorization DECISION. {@link requireToolPermission}
 * performs a check a caller asks for; it never decides that a check is needed. The "one
 * evaluator" rule is a per-tool fact — some domains self-enforce inside their service function and
 * must NOT be double-checked here, others have no service-layer gate at all and must be checked at
 * the handler — and that judgement stays recorded in the domain file next to the handler it
 * describes, where a reviewer reading the handler can see it.
