/**
 * @file Core port contracts for the CMS runtime.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Defines the stable interfaces that domain/application code depends on.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * - `features/*` import these contracts to stay framework/provider-agnostic.
 * - `core/memory-bus.ts` provides in-memory implementations for local dev/tests.
 * - `core/outbox-worker.ts` orchestrates reliable async delivery using these ports.
 * - `server/app.ts` composes concrete implementations and runs the slice.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * This file is the dependency inversion seam. Concrete infrastructure can change
 * without changing feature logic as long as implementations satisfy these types.
 */
