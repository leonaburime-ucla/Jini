/**
 * @file Real `ImageTransformerPort` adapter — calls `sharp` to actually
 * resize/re-encode pixels (renditions are always re-encoded,
 * never passed through unmodified).
 *
 * `sharp` is an OPTIONAL runtime dependency of this package (mirrors
 * `identity/hasher.ts`'s treatment of `argon2`), not a hard one — a host that
 * only wants `InMemoryImageTransformer` (tests, or a build that has no need
 * for real pixel transforms) must not be forced to install a native binary
 * just by importing `./media`. Two consequences follow:
 *
 * 1. `sharp` is loaded via `node:module`'s `createRequire`, not a static
 *    `import`/`require` of the string `"sharp"` — this is what lets the
 *    module resolve and typecheck even in an environment/build where `sharp`
 *    is not installed at all. Nothing in this package's own `tsconfig.json`
 *    needs `sharp`'s types as a result: the narrow `SharpFactory`/
 *    `SharpInstance` shapes below are hand-declared and the loaded value is
 *    cast to them, exactly the same "not statically type-checked against the
 *    real package" contract the original of this adapter always had.
 * 2. The load is deferred to the moment a transform actually needs to run,
 *    not to module-evaluation time. This file is reachable from a host's
 *    request-serving import graph (wired into its route deps for the real
 *    running server), so a top-level import would throw `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`
 *    on every boot, for every request, even ones that never touch a
 *    transform, if `sharp` were ever absent. The lazy load scopes that
 *    failure mode to the one call site that needs it, surfaced as
 *    {@link ImageTransformUnavailableError} — a named, thrown error, not a
 *    silently-passed-through/faked image.

 * "the codec itself couldn't even be loaded".
 *
 * This is a DATA condition on the stored blob, not a server fault: bytes can pass this package's own
 * allowlist upload check and even its magic-byte sniff (`content-type-sniffer.ts`) while still being
 * bytes libvips refuses to decode (an intentionally-crafted upload, a partial/interrupted write, a
 * container variant this codec build doesn't support, ...). A caller (a serving route) is expected to
 * catch this specifically and answer a controlled 4xx, never an opaque 500 — same "named, thrown
 * error, never a silently faked/passed-through image" discipline this file's own header already
 * states for the sibling `ImageTransformUnavailableError` case.
