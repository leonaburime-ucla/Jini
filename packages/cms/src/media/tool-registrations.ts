/**
 * @file Media's tool-registration wiring: maps `agent-tools.ts`'s four catalog entries onto
 * `media-service.ts`'s list/upload/update/trash operations, as `ToolRegistration`s. The entire
 * catalog is wired — `purgeMedia` is deliberately absent from the catalog rather than
 * present-but-unwired; see `media/agent-tools.ts`'s own header.
 *
 * Authorization shape: unlike Forms/Identity/Widgets, `media-service.ts`'s functions perform NO
 * internal `authorize()` call of their own — every admin HTTP route a host builds gates inline
 * instead. Every handler here does the same via the kit's `requireToolPermission`, which is the
 * single evaluation for these tools, located where a real route would locate it.
 *
 * `publicUrl` (2026-09-02, closing the same capability gap `features/post/tool-registrations.ts`'s
 * own `publicUrl` addition closed there: an agent could upload/list an asset but had no tool-facing
 * way to learn a URL usable to embed it in a post/page). Unlike `post`, this package has no host to
 * resolve a public URL against — the `/m/{assetId}/{transformName}.v{version}/...` contract
 * (ADR-027 §4) is a HOST decision (which URL prefix, which transform pipeline, whether one even
 * exists), not a `@jini-ai/cms` one; this package deliberately has zero `/m/`-shaped string
 * literals anywhere. So `publicUrl` is resolved through an OPTIONAL, host-injected
 * {@link MediaToolDeps.resolvePublicUrls}, batch-shaped (one call per `media_list_assets`/
 * `media_upload_asset` invocation, not one per asset) so a host backing it with a real lookup
 * (content-type/blob-store reads) never pays N queries for an N-row list. A host that omits it gets
 * today's exact behavior unchanged — `publicUrl` simply never appears on the response, which is why
 * this stays additive rather than a breaking change to every existing consumer of this file.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT added to `media_update_metadata`/`media_trash_asset` — mirrors
 * `features/post/tool-registrations.ts`'s identical reasoning for skipping `content_post_update`/
 * `content_post_delete`: those two return the row incidentally, to confirm what was just
 * edited/trashed, not to answer "where does this live".

   * and then discards it by design (see that file's own header) — neither `AssetBlobRecord` nor
   * `MediaRecord` has a field for it, so this package cannot persist one itself. A host that wants
   * one recorded (e.g. so an admin "Images"/"Videos" filter or a public rendition route can answer
   * "what type is this blob") wires this hook to its own content-type store, exactly the same
   * pattern {@link resolvePublicUrls} already established for `publicUrl`.
   *
   * Deliberately given the RAW UPLOADED BYTES, not the caller's declared `contentType` string: a
   * host is expected to derive the real type from bytes (a magic-byte sniff), never trust the
   * declared string outright — the same "an attacker-controlled `contentType` header is trusted,
   * which the real ingress policy would never do" gap `uploadMedia`'s own header already discloses
   * for the validation step. This hook is this package's only chance to hand a host those bytes
   * before they go out of scope; asking a host to re-read them later would mean either persisting
   * the client-declared string untrusted (the exact gap this hook exists to avoid) or a second blob
   * read the host does not otherwise need.
   *
   * Any rejection from this hook propagates out of the `media_upload_asset` handler uncaught — a
   * failure to record the type is a real failure, not swallowed to report a false success (mirrors
   * `resolveCredentialForProvider`'s "never silently fall through" discipline elsewhere in this
   * package's siblings). Omitted entirely: never called, matching this field's own pre-fix absence
   * for every host that has not opted in yet — the exact `resolvePublicUrls`-precedent contract.
