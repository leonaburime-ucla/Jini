/**
 * @file Domain types + typed errors for the `media` library.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `MediaRecord` is the editorial half of a media asset; `AssetBlobRecord` and
 * `AssetRenditionRecord` are the two core-owned operational sidecars the
 * original design specifies.
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE (disclosed, not a silent deviation): the original design describes media as a
 * seeded `entries` content-type entry — editorial fields live under
 * `bodyJson.$.source`/`fields.ext.media.*` on a generic entry row, with
 * revisions/taxonomy/`entry_refs` for free. That generic `entries` model does
 * not exist as running code in the host that first built this yet (it is
 * accepted design only; `post` itself is still a bespoke first-class table,
 * not a generic entry). `MediaRecord` below is therefore built the same way a
 * bespoke `post`-style record is built: a bespoke record with its editorial
 * fields inlined directly. When a generic entries system ships, `media`
 * should migrate onto it the same way `post` eventually will — this file is
 * not a competing permanent design, it is that pattern applied to media.
 *
 * The two sidecars (`AssetBlobRecord`, `AssetRenditionRecord`) ARE built as
 * the original design describes — they were always meant to be core-owned tables
 * independent of the entries model, so no scope adjustment was needed there.
