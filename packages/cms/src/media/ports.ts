/**
 * @file Port contracts for the `media` library.
 *
 * Ports declared here (port/adapter rule-of-two — each has a real second adapter in
 * this build):
 *  - `MediaRepoPort` / `AssetBlobRepoPort` / `AssetRenditionRepoPort` — in-memory
 *    now; a SQLite adapter is a host concern (composition roots bind their own
 *    concrete class against this port, the same disclosed precedent several
 *    other domains follow for their own repo ports).
 *  - `BlobStorePort` — content-addressed byte storage. Adapters: local
 *    filesystem (`blob-store.fs.ts`, real for this build) + in-memory test
 *    double (`blob-store.memory.ts`).
 *
 * `BlobStorePort`'s surface is deliberately narrower than the full
 * design: no `capabilities()`/`createPresignedUpload()` (the presign surface is
 * explicitly deferred by this task's scope). It has one method beyond the
 * task's stated minimal 3 (`put`/`get`/`exists`): `remove()`. That addition is
 * necessary to implement `purgeMedia`'s explicitly-requested "best-effort blob
 * unlink" (see `media-service.ts`) — without a way to delete bytes, purge could
 * only ever delete rows, never reclaim storage. This is disclosed here, not
 * silently smuggled in: it is still far short of the real journaled
 * GC protocol (no epochs, no `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, no crash-safety guarantee).
 *
 * Interfaces only — no feature logic.
