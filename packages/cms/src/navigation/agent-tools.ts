/**
 * @file The Navigation (Menus) agent-tool catalog — this domain's instance of the
 * per-domain `agent-tools.ts` convention `forms/agent-tools.ts` and `identity/agent-tools.ts`
 * already use.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * A static, in-process catalog describing every agent-callable tool this domain exposes and the
 * permission each carries. Every entry maps 1:1 onto a real exported function of
 * `navigation/menu-service.ts` (plus two pure reads over `MenuRepoPort`) — this catalog never names
 * an operation the domain cannot perform.
 *
 * Precedent already in this library: `navigation/contracts.ts` declares `NAVIGATION_AI_TOOLS` — a
 * design-note list of an intended future AI tool surface (`navigation.search`/`.get`/`.where_used`/
 * `.update`/`.assign`) for a DIFFERENT, not-yet-built delivery mechanism (a "change-set review
 * layer" HITL gateway; the list itself is unused anywhere in this build today). Two of its five
 * names do not correspond to any real, callable capability in this build: `navigation.search` has
 * no implementation beyond `MenuRepoPort.list` (folded into `menus_list_menus` below — there is no
 * separate text-search capability, matching how `identity_user_list`/`identity_role_list` are
 * likewise this library's "search" for their own domains), and `navigation.where_used` has no
 * implementation anywhere (`NavWhereUsedResult` is declared in `contracts.ts` but no function in
 * `navigation/` computes it — `entry_refs`-backed where-used, unlike `widgets`/`media`, was never
 * built for menus). Wrapping either literally would invent backend capability this catalog's own
 * discipline forbids; `menus_list_menus` + `menus_get_menu` are this build's honest equivalents of
 * "search"/"get".
 *
 * Deliberate absence (the point of a catalog, not an oversight):
 * - There is NO `menus_delete_menu` (nor a separate trash-only tool). `deleteMenu` is ONE function
 *   that performs BOTH steps of the deletion ladder, keyed off the menu's CURRENT status:
 *   a first call trashes (safe, unconditional), but a second call against an already-trashed menu
 *   PURGES it — a hard, irreversible delete, blocked only by a still-bound-location guard that
 *   itself can be bypassed with `force` (gated behind the separate `admin.menus.delete.force`
 *   permission). Unlike `widgets`/`media` (which expose trash and purge as two SEPARATE domain
 *   functions, letting a catalog safely wire trash alone), navigation has no decomposed trash-only
 *   entrypoint to call — the very same tool call, made twice, silently escalates from a reversible
 *   soft-delete into a permanent one. That is exactly the shape of risk `identity/agent-tools.ts`
 *   excludes `resetUserPassword` for: a single lever whose second pull does something categorically
 *   more dangerous than its first, reachable by an agent re-invoking a tool it already called once
 *   (e.g. after losing track of a prior call, or via prompt injection through ordinary operator
 *   content). Left human-UI-only.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * A host's own tool-registration layer maps these entries into `ToolRegistration`s (see
 * `tool-registrations.ts`). Unlike Forms/Identity/Widgets, `menu-service.ts`'s functions perform NO
 * internal `authorize()` call of their own (confirmed: `CreateMenuDeps`/`UpdateMenuTreeDeps`/
 * `AssignLocationDeps` carry no `authorize` field) — every admin HTTP route a host builds is expected
 * to check `deps.authorize(...)` inline, before calling the service function (mirrors `media`'s
 * identical gap, see `media/agent-tools.ts`'s header). `tool-registrations.ts` therefore performs
 * that SAME inline `authorize()` call itself (the identical permission string and `entityType:
 * "menu"` the HTTP route uses) rather than relying on a domain-layer gate that does not exist for
 * this library.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `navigation` domain declaration. Imports only `VALID_TARGET_KINDS`-equivalent constants are not
 * exported from `menu-service.ts` as public data (the target-kind allowlist is enforced, not
 * published, there), so the target schema below is hand-authored against `types.ts`'s `NavTarget`
 * union and cross-checked by this catalog's own contract test rather than imported.
