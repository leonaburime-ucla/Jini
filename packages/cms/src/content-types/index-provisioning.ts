/**
 * @file CIC U-001 — the `kind`->`CAST` fixed lookup table, the identifier grammar
 * gate, the workspace-scoped queryable-index naming scheme, and the before/after index-transition
 * resolver (grammar-and-workspace-scoping folds).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * THIS IS THE HIGHEST-SECURITY-SEVERITY MODULE IN THE 5-PACKAGE PIPELINE — every value that ends
 * up inside a `CREATE INDEX ... CAST(json_extract(fields,'$.ext.{ns}.{field}') AS {type})`
 * statement is produced here, and only here:
 *   - `mapFieldKindToCast` (U-001-B1). STATE THE INVARIANT PRECISELY, because an earlier version
 *     of this comment did not and the imprecision was itself a hazard: it said "a fixed, hardcoded
 *     5-entry table", which reads as though the ENTRY COUNT were the defense. It is not. Neither
 *     the number of keys nor the number of distinct values is the security boundary.
 *
 *     THE DEFENSE IS: this function returns a VALUE FROM THE TABLE and never returns, echoes, or
 *     interpolates its own ARGUMENT. The function has exactly one `return`, and it is a table
 *     lookup. Therefore the set of strings that can reach a `CAST(... AS {type})` position is
 *     exactly the set of string literals written into `KIND_TO_CAST_LITERAL` in this source file —
 *     compile-time constants, every one — no matter what an operator, an agent, or an attacker
 *     supplies as `kind`. A 50-entry table of literals would be exactly as safe as a 5-entry one.
 *
 *     What follows from that, and what a maintainer actually needs to know:
 *       * Adding a KEY whose value is an existing literal cannot widen the DDL alphabet. It is not
 *         a security event and does not need to be feared as one. (`relation: "TEXT"` is exactly
 *         this: `"TEXT"` was already present twice.)
 *       * Adding a new VALUE does widen it, and must be reviewed as a DDL change.
 *       * Returning, concatenating, or template-interpolating `kind` itself — or reading the table
 *         with a fallback such as `?? kind` — BREAKS the invariant outright. That is the edit to
 *         refuse, and it is the one the old "5-entry" phrasing gave no way to recognise.
 *     The reachable-value set is pinned executably by `HISTORICAL_DDL_ALPHABET` in
 *     `__tests__/field-kind-widening.test.ts`, so this claim is a failing test and not only prose.
 *
 *     Degraded failure mode, stated so the blast radius is known: if every runtime guard below
 *     were deleted, a storage-only kind would reach the table and `KIND_TO_CAST_LITERAL["json"]`
 *     would evaluate to `undefined` — a SQL syntax error and a loud broken feature, never an
 *     operator-controlled string. Total guard removal degrades this module to unavailable, not to
 *     injectable. That is the property worth preserving through any future change.
 *   - `validateIdentifierGrammar`/`buildQueryableFieldIndexName` gate every `key`/field name
 *     through `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$` before it can reach an index-name segment or JSON-path
 *     literal (U-001-B2), and join grammar-gated segments with `/` — a delimiter outside the
 *     grammar's own alphabet `[a-z0-9_]`, closing the namespace-injectivity collision class
 *     (U-001-B3) — and fold in a workspace-derived segment so two workspaces defining the same
 *     `(key, field)` pair never collide on index identity.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * `resolveFieldIndexTransition` deliberately still ACCEPTS a storage-only kind on its `none` and
 * `teardown` arms while rejecting it on the two provisioning arms. Teardown must stay reachable:
 * an index left behind by a bypassed or since-added guard has to remain droppable, and a resolver
 * that refused to look at the kind at all could never order that cleanup.
 *
 * `write-service.ts`'s `registerContentType`/`updateContentTypeFields` call
 * `resolveFieldIndexTransition` once per field (never two independent kind/queryable branches —
 * CIC U-003-B1) and hand the result to the injected `indexProvisioner` port, which is the only
 * thing that ever issues the real `CREATE INDEX`/`DROP INDEX` DDL (this module only decides what
 * to build, never executes DDL itself).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `features/content-types` domain logic. No dependencies beyond `node:crypto` (workspace-segment
 * hashing) and this package's own `errors.ts`/`types.ts`.
