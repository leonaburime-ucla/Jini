/**
 * @file Typed error surface for the `content-types` package.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Every rejection this package's write-service/lifecycle/cleanup/index-provisioning modules
 * produce is one of these classes, never a bare `Error`/string, so callers (routes, agent tools,
 * tests) can branch on `instanceof` or on `.name` without parsing a message.
 *
 * `class X extends Error {}` does NOT give an instance a `.name` of `"X"` on this runtime unless
 * the constructor sets `this.name` explicitly (confirmed empirically in Session 2 of this
 * workstream) — every class below sets it.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `features/content-types` domain logic. No dependencies.

 * to provision.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY A SUBCLASS of {@link InvalidFieldKindError}, not a sibling. The fronting HTTP
 * boundaries map rejections with a fixed `instanceof` list and fall through to
 * `500 INTERNAL_ERROR`; they live in consuming applications, outside this package, and cannot be
 * updated in lockstep with it. A sibling class would therefore turn a validation rejection into a
 * 500 at every existing boundary the day this shipped. Subclassing keeps every such boundary at
 * `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` with no coordinated change, and the relationship is honest — this IS a
 * rejection of the field's kind, in the context the kind was used. `.name` still distinguishes it
 * for any caller that wants the finer signal.
