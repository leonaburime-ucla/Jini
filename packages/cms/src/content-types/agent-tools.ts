/**
 * @file REQ-22/REQ-23 — the Collections content-types agent-tool catalog, instantiating
 * a REQ-22 naming/callability convention (mirrors `features/database/agent-tools.ts`'s
 * shape for this domain).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * A static, in-process catalog describing every agent-callable tool this domain exposes and the
 * permission/actor-class rule each one carries. `collections_content_type_list` (admin-UI-backend-
 * gap closure, mirroring `routes/admin/content-types/list.ts`) and `collections_plan_cleanup` are
 * both free reads (`admin.collections.read`, `sideEffects:'none'`) — the former lists the registry,
 * the latter only recomputes and returns an eligibility plan. `collections_execute_cleanup` is the
 * one destructive tool, gated to
 * `admin.collections.manage` and restricted to `confirmer-must-equal-own-delegatedBy`. There is
 * deliberately no `collections_confirm_cleanup` tool and no tool description implying an agent can
 * perform the confirm() step — confirmation of a destructive cleanup is human-UI-only (mirrors
 * the Database library's "Restore is a Recovery tool, not a Database tool" discipline: a lever an agent must
 * never be handed directly).
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * The server-side tool filter consumes this catalog to decide which tool names an agent
 * session may even see; `authorize()` and the confirmation-token gateway (`core/gated-mutations`)
 * enforce the actual permission/actor-class checks at call time — this module only declares the
 * catalog shape, it performs no I/O and no enforcement itself.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `features/content-types` domain logic. Performs no I/O and no enforcement. Depends only on this
 * package's own `types.ts` (the field-kind enum) and `index-provisioning.ts` (the identifier
 * grammar pattern) — imported so the published JSON Schemas cannot drift from the single sources
 * of those two values, rather than restating either.

   * handlers yet and their input shape is not designed; `tool-registrations.ts` asserts that every
   * tool it DOES wire has one.
   *
   * These schemas are hand-authored, and enforcement lives elsewhere — `field-defs.ts` for
   * structure and `write-service.ts`'s CIC U-002-B1 chain for the domain rules. That is a
   * deliberate two-artifact design, so the pair is pinned against drift by a fixture corpus in
   * `__tests__/unit/agent-tools.schema-agreement.unit.test.ts`. The two values a schema would
   * otherwise duplicate — the field-kind enum and the identifier grammar — are imported from their
   * single sources rather than restated.
