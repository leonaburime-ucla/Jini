/**
 * @file First-boot identity seed (REQ-09, state.spec `SEED_FIRST_BOOT`).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Seeds, in one idempotent pass: a `system` principal; a disabled legacy
 * `user-local` principal (REQ-09/EC-09 — so any pre-existing `change_sets`
 * stamped `actorId='user-local'` satisfy the composite FK without rewriting
 * history); four built-in roles (`owner`/`admin`/`editor`/
 * `viewer`) each 1:1 with a built-in policy; and the initial `owner` user.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * - Called once by each composition root (`server/app.ts` in-memory,
 *   `server/deps.ts` SQLite-content-with-in-memory-identity) before the
 *   server accepts requests. `RouteDeps.identityReady` is this call's
 *   promise — auth-adjacent middleware awaits it (see `middleware/dev-auth.ts`).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Seed data lives in one place so both composition roots stay identical
 * (mirrors `server/seed.ts`'s reasoning for workspace/post/presentation seed
 * data). Idempotent: re-seeding an already-seeded workspace is a no-op
 * (checked via the owner username).

 * still log in, and holds no role — and `resolveEffectivePermissions` (`authorize.ts`) starts from
 * `principal_roles` + `principal_policies`, so with neither present EVERY permission evaluates to
 * `no_grant`. Without this step the guard early-returns on the user it finds forever and the site
 * stays bricked for its owner, silently. Neither host-side reconciler closes it either: Tovu's
 * `migrateDeprecatedPermissionGrants` and `applyBuiltinRoleGrants` are handed policy and role repos
 * only, never `principalRoles`, so neither can write a principal->role link at all.
 *
 * Why the gate is "holds NO role" rather than "lacks the owner role". Those two conditions differ
 * on exactly one workspace shape, and it matters: an operator who moves the seeded owner principal
 * to a lesser role leaves it lacking the owner link on purpose. Repairing on that broader signal
 * would re-escalate the principal to wildcard authority on the next restart — a privilege
 * escalation shipped as a bug fix. A principal holding no role at all is never a deliberate state;
 * it is only ever the interrupted seed, so that is what this repairs.
 *
 * Converges rather than assuming: it goes through `seedBuiltinRoleWithPolicy`, so a workspace whose
 * owner ROLE or wildcard grant also never landed gains those here instead of being linked to a role
 * that grants nothing. `principal_roles` carries no unique index, hence the read-before-write.
 *
 * @complexity O(1) — a handful of point reads on a healthy boot (one `listByPrincipalId`, which
 * returns early), plus the fixed converge pass for the owner role only when the repair fires.
