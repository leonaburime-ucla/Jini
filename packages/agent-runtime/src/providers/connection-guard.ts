/**
 * @module providers/connection-guard
 *
 * Minimal, self-contained SSRF-guard + secret-redaction utilities needed by
 * this package's own `model-catalog.ts`. Vendored from the small generic
 * subset of OD's `packages/contracts/src/api/connectionTest.ts` (the
 * `isLoopbackApiHost`/`isBlockedExternalApiHostname`/`validateBaseUrl` triad)
 * and `apps/daemon/src/connectionTest.ts` (`validateBaseUrlResolved`'s
 * DNS-aware follow-up check, `redactSecrets`) — not the surrounding
 * 2,600-line file, which is almost entirely OD's own agent-CLI
 * connection-test orchestration (proxy dispatchers, product-specific
 * executable-fallback copy and env-var names) and out of this task's
 * scope; see `source-map.md` for the exact origin details. These four
 * functions are pure security/text utilities with
 * no product coupling in the origin — reject requests to loopback-disguised
 * or RFC1918/link-local/CGNAT/metadata-service addresses, and strip bearer
 * tokens / API-key headers / `?key=` query values out of free-form text
 * before it is logged or surfaced to a caller.
 *
 * Also exports `pinnedFetch` — a `node:https`/`node:http`-based POST that dials the exact address
 * `validateBaseUrlResolved` already validated, instead of leaving the transport to re-resolve DNS
 * independently when it connects. Added later than the four functions above, for the same
 * dependency-free package; see `pinnedFetch`'s own doc for why `fetch()` itself cannot do this.
 *
 * ## Paired with `@jini-ai/ui`'s `utils/endpoint-policy.ts`
 *
 * That module carries a browser-safe copy of the SYNCHRONOUS half below —
 * `isLoopbackApiHost`/`isBlockedExternalApiHostname`/`validateBaseUrl` — so the
 * settings tabs can reject a bad endpoint as the operator types it. It is a
 * copy rather than an import because `endpoint-policy.ts` itself has zero
 * imports by design and this package is Node-only (`validateBaseUrlResolved`
 * needs `node:dns`); see that file's header for the full reasoning.
 *
 * **If the block-list here changes, change it there too.** A divergence means
 * the UI accepts an endpoint this guard then refuses — or, in the direction
 * that actually matters, the UI accepts one this guard would have refused.

/**
 * DNS-aware companion to {@link validateBaseUrl}. The synchronous check only
 * inspects the literal hostname string, so a public DNS name pointing at
 * internal infrastructure (`internal.example.com -> 10.0.0.5`) slips through
 * and a caller ends up issuing a request to a private address on behalf of
 * whoever supplied the base URL. Resolves the hostname and re-runs the
 * block-list against every address the system would actually connect to.
 *
 * Loopback is intentionally allowed (for local LLM servers like Ollama); any
 * hostname that resolves to a loopback address (including `*.localhost` per
 * RFC 6761 and IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback) follows the same carve-out.
 *
 * ## The TOCTOU this closes, and how
 *
 * A validator that only checks and returns pass/fail has a gap: `fetch` (or any transport) then
 * resolves the hostname AGAIN, independently, when it dials. Between those two resolutions the
 * answer can change — a DNS rebinding attacker returns a public address to this check and a
 * private one to the connection. No amount of re-checking closes that on its own; the request has
 * to dial the exact address that was approved. So this function does the resolution exactly ONCE
 * and hands the first validated address back as `pinnedAddress` — feed it to {@link pinnedFetch},
 * which dials that address directly instead of letting the transport re-resolve. `pinnedAddress` is
 * only set when a lookup actually happened (i.e. never for the loopback-literal / IP-literal hosts
 * below, which need no pinning: an IP literal never re-resolves to anything else, and loopback
 * literals are outside this threat model — see the carve-out above).
 *
 * That said, `baseUrl` here is operator-configured provider config, not attacker-supplied input —
 * pinning is defence-in-depth rather than the primary trust boundary. Callers should additionally
 * refuse redirects (`redirect: 'error'`), which closes the OTHER way a validated origin reaches an
 * unvalidated address; `pinnedFetch` never follows one regardless (`node:https`/`node:http` don't,
 * unlike `fetch`'s default), but callers still pass `redirect: 'error'` for self-documentation.
 *
 * DNS lookup failures are not treated as a security signal — the caller is
 * going to surface a connection error from `fetch` anyway, and turning a
 * transient resolver hiccup into a rejection would just confuse callers. The
 * synchronous hostname check still rejects the obvious literal-IP cases
 * before DNS is ever consulted. `lookup` defaults to `node:dns`'s promise
 * `lookup(hostname, { all: true, family: 0 })`, injectable for tests and for
 * hosts that already own a resolver.
