/**
 * @module providers/sse-decode
 *
 * Minimal, tolerant Server-Sent-Events *frame decoder* for an INBOUND
 * provider stream — the response body a call to the Anthropic Messages API
 * or the OpenAI Chat Completions API sends back when `stream: true` is
 * requested. This is deliberately not `@jini/http`'s `sse.ts`: that module
 * is the OUTBOUND channel a route uses to push events to a browser client
 * (bounded queue, backpressure, `Last-Event-ID` replay). This module has
 * none of that — it only turns a raw byte/text stream into `{event, data}`
 * frames per the SSE wire format (`text/event-stream`, RFC-ish: fields
 * separated by `\n`, records separated by a blank line), so a provider-
 * specific turn-runner (`anthropic-messages.ts`, `openai-chat.ts`) can
 * `JSON.parse` each frame's `data` field without re-deriving line/record
 * framing itself.
 *
 * New file, not a port — chat.ts's origin used the Node `fetch` global's
 * response body directly with ad hoc inline buffering per call site; this
 * factors that concern into one shared, independently-tested primitive so
 * both provider turn-runners consume the same framing logic (the same
 * "shared mechanism, one implementation" discipline `@jini/http`'s
 * `sse.ts`/`origin-validation.ts` already apply to their own domains).

/** One decoded SSE record. `event` is `null` when the record had no `event:` line (OpenAI's Chat Completions stream never sends one; every `data:` line is implicitly a plain message). `data` is the joined value of every `data:` line in the record (multi-line `data:` fields are joined with `\n`, per the SSE spec). */

 * Decodes an inbound byte/text stream into SSE records. Accepts either
 * `Uint8Array` chunks (a real `fetch` response body) or `string` chunks (test
 * fixtures, or any caller that already has decoded text) in the same
 * iterable — this keeps unit tests free of any need to construct a real web
 * `ReadableStream`, matching this package's existing `fetch`-mocking
 * convention (`vi.stubGlobal('fetch', ...)`, see `model-catalog.test.ts`).
 *
 * Tolerant per the SSE spec: accepts both `\n` and `\r\n` line endings,
 * ignores comment lines (leading `:`) and unrecognized field names (`id`/
 * `retry` are parsed by real SSE clients for reconnect bookkeeping, which is
 * meaningless for a single proxied request/response pair, so this decoder
 * intentionally drops them), and flushes a trailing unterminated record —
 * even one whose very last line has no trailing `\n` at all — once the
 * source iterable ends, so a provider closing the connection immediately
 * after its last byte never silently loses that last record.
