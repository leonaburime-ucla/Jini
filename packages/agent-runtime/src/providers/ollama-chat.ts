/**
 * @module providers/ollama-chat
 *
 * Ollama native Chat API wire adapter + tool-loop turn-runner. Sibling of
 * `anthropic-messages.ts`/`openai-chat.ts`/`azure-chat.ts` — see those
 * modules' headers for the shared design rationale.
 *
 * **Corrected to match Open Design's real behavior** (an earlier version of
 * this module targeted Ollama's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`
 * surface instead — found wrong by a live side-by-side comparison against a
 * running OD daemon, `apps/daemon/src/routes/chat.ts:1298`'s real
 * `/api/proxy/ollama/stream` handler):
 *
 * - **Endpoint**: `{baseUrl}/api/chat` — Ollama's own native chat API, not
 *   the OpenAI-compatible shim. `baseUrl` has any trailing `/api` stripped
 *   before appending, matching OD's `.replace(/\/api\/?$/, '')`.
 * - **Wire format**: newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON), one JSON object per
 *   line, terminated by a line with `"done": true` — NOT Server-Sent
 *   Events. `text_delta`s come from `message.content`; the terminal line's
 *   `done: true` ends the stream (see `runSingleOllamaRequest` below).
 * - **`apiKey` is required**, like every other provider — OD's real handler
 *   rejects a request with no `apiKey` (`if (!apiKey || !model)`), because
 *   its default target is Ollama Cloud (see next point), not a bare local
 *   install.
 * - **Default `baseUrl` is `https://ollama.com`** (Ollama Cloud), matching
 *   OD's `effectiveBaseUrl = baseUrl || 'https://ollama.com'` — not a local
 *   loopback address. A caller running a real local Ollama install still
 *   just passes `baseUrl: 'http://localhost:11434'` explicitly; the
 *   loopback carve-out in `connection-guard.ts` (documented there as
 *   existing "for local LLM servers like Ollama") still applies when they
 *   do.
 * - **Token limit**: `options.num_predict` (Ollama's native token-limit
 *   field), sent only when `maxTokens` is a positive number — matches OD's
 *   `if (typeof maxTokens === 'number' && maxTokens > 0) payload.options = {
 *   num_predict: maxTokens }`.
 *
 * **Round-4 external audit fix (`AUD-R4-002`)**: the first port of this
 * module's tool-call loop kept the OpenAI-compatible wire shape for both the
 * emitted lifecycle event and the continuation request — `tool_use` was
 * never emitted, and the assistant/tool continuation messages used a
 * stringified `arguments` blob plus a `type` discriminator that does not
 * exist in Ollama's native tool-call schema. (Narrowed 2026-08-03: this note
 * previously also named `id`/`tool_call_id` as nonexistent, which is wrong —
 * see `OllamaMessageParam.tool_name`'s doc for what `api/types.go` actually
 * declares. `type` is the only genuinely absent field.) Fixed: `tool_use` now
 * fires for every resolved call as soon as the stream ends (see
 * `runSingleOllamaRequest`), and `OllamaToolCallParam`/`OllamaMessageParam`
 * now match Ollama's own documented shape (`arguments` as a native object,
 * `tool_name` instead of `tool_call_id` — see those interfaces' docs).
 *
 * **Deliberate extension beyond OD's own scope, not a parity gap**: OD's
 * ollama handler never builds a `tools` field into its request and never
 * reads `message.tool_calls` from the response — its own ollama proxy has
 * no tool-calling support at all. Ollama's real native `/api/chat` API does
 * support tool calling (a `tools` array in the same OpenAI
 * function-declaration shape on the request, `message.tool_calls: [{id?,
 * function: {name, arguments}}]` on a non-streaming-final response chunk —
 * see `github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#chat-request-with-
 * tools`). This module keeps that capability (as the original, pre-parity-
 * fix version of this file already did) rather than removing working
 * functionality just to match a gap in OD's own product scope — matching
 * this repo's established practice elsewhere (e.g. `xai.ts` deliberately
 * generalizing OD's OAuth-connect *shape* while dropping its OD-specific
 * SuperGrok billing gate).
 *
 * **Image ("vision") support**, added for the same vision self-check use
 * case as `anthropic-messages.ts` (see that module's doc). Ollama's real
 * wire shape is genuinely unlike every other provider this repo's adapters
 * touch: `Message.Images` (`github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/api/
 * types.go`) is `[]ImageData` where `ImageData` is a raw Go `[]byte` —
 * `encoding/json` marshals a byte slice as a **bare base64 string**, so
 * there is no `data:` URI prefix and no `media_type` field at all (unlike
 * Anthropic/OpenAI's wrapped-source shapes). Confirmed directly against that
 * struct, not assumed from the "list of images" prose in `docs/api.md`.
 *
 * **Design decision: native `tool`-role images, not a synthetic follow-up
 * turn.** A prior pass on this same task (see `ADS-memory/reports/refactors/
 * 2026-08-03-image-send-capability.md`) found OpenAI/Azure/Google's `tool`-
 * role message is documented text-only, so those three need a synthetic
 * `user`-role follow-up turn to carry an image at all. Ollama does not need
 * that workaround — verified, not assumed, against two independent pieces of
 * real server-side evidence: (1) `api/types.go`'s `Message` struct puts
 * `Images` at the same level as `Role`/`Content`/`ToolName`, with no
 * role-conditional field; (2) `server/prompt.go`'s `imageTaggedMessages`
 * function, which actually builds the model prompt, iterates every message
 * regardless of `Role` and reads `msg.Images` unconditionally — there is no
 * `if msg.Role == "user"` gate anywhere near that read. A `tool`-role
 * message's `images` field therefore reaches the model exactly like a
 * `user`-role message's would. This makes Ollama's tool-result channel
 * behave like Anthropic's (native), not like OpenAI/Azure/Google's
 * (workaround required) — a third shape the prior pass's provider table
 * did not anticipate, because Ollama was outside its original four-protocol
 * scope.
 *
 * **`OllamaToolResult.isError` added alongside `images`, not purely a vision
 * change.** Before this pass, every `tool_result` event and continuation
 * message hardcoded `isError: false` regardless of what `executeTool`
 * returned — `OllamaToolResult` had no `isError` field for a host to even
 * set. That is a pre-existing gap independent of images, but this pass's own
 * `guardToolResult` (see below) needs to signal a rejected/malformed image
 * as an error the model can see, which is impossible without it. Wired
 * through as `result.isError ?? false`, so every existing caller that never
 * set `isError` keeps its exact prior behavior.
