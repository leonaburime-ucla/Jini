/**
 * Declares that a runtime carries its reasoning-effort choice INSIDE the model
 * id — as a trailing `-<level>` on the slug — rather than in a flag of its own.
 *
 * The distinction is not cosmetic, and it is why this is a separate field from
 * `RuntimeAgentDef.reasoningOptions` rather than another shape of it:
 *
 *   - A `reasoningOptions` def (claude, codex) has ONE effort vocabulary that
 *     applies to every model it can run, and the chosen level travels to the
 *     CLI as its own argv (`--effort high`, `-c model_reasoning_effort="high"`)
 *     via `RuntimeBuildOptions.reasoning`.
 *   - A `reasoningInModelId` def (antigravity) has NO effort flag at all. Its
 *     level is already part of `--model`'s value, so `buildArgs` emits nothing
 *     extra, and — critically — **the available levels differ per base model**.
 *     Verified live against `agy models` (v1.1.25): `gemini-3.8-flash` has
 *     high/medium/low, `gemini-3.1-pro` has ONLY high and low,
 *     `gpt-oss-120b` has only medium, and `claude-sonnet-4-6` has none.
 *     `agy --model gemini-3.1-pro-medium` is rejected outright.
 *
 * So this field declares only the suffix VOCABULARY — which trailing tokens
 * are effort levels at all, in the order a picker should offer them. Which of
 * them exist for a given base model is DERIVED from that runtime's own model
 * list (live or fallback), never listed here: a hand-written per-model table
 * would be a second copy of the CLI's catalog, free to drift the moment
 * upstream adds a variant.
 *
 * `levels` doubles as the guard against over-parsing: `claude-opus-4-6-thinking`
 * ends in `-thinking`, which is NOT an effort level, so it must stay part of
 * the base id. Only a trailing token that appears in `levels` is a level.

  // point; see its own doc), never by `def.id`.
  //
  // Leave undefined (the default, and every def's behavior before this field existed) for the
  // universal fallback: the caller prefixes the overlay directly onto the composed prompt text,
  // clearly delimited from the user's own request, before `buildArgs` ever sees it — no def code
  // change needed to receive it. The one thing a def with no declared strategy must still get
  // right in its own semantics is unaffected: this only changes what `buildArgs`'s `prompt`
  // argument already contains, not how the def uses it.
  //
  //   'append-flag' — the CLI has its own append-only system-prompt argv flag (appends to the
  //                   CLI's own default instructions, never replaces them — a def whose only
  //                   native mechanism *replaces* the CLI's baked-in instructions instead should
  //                   NOT declare this strategy; leave it undefined and take the prefix fallback,
  //                   which is strictly safer than silently discarding the CLI's own defaults).
  //                   `flag` names the argv flag. `capabilityKey`, when present, names the
  //                   `capabilityFlags`/`agentCapabilities` key gating it (an older CLI build
  //                   rejects an unknown flag with exit 1 — see `defs/claude.ts`'s own doc on this
  //                   exact hazard); omit it only for a flag already confirmed unconditionally
  //                   present (e.g. `pi`'s pre-existing, already-in-use `--append-system-prompt`).
  //   'env-var'     — the CLI reads a dedicated env var as its own system-prompt-append hook
  //                   (`reasonix`'s `REASONIX_ACP_SYSTEM_APPEND` — see `defs/reasonix.ts`'s own
  //                   doc for why this shape, distinct from `append-flag`, exists at all: the
  //                   original OD source read this env var directly and there is no argv
  //                   equivalent). `varName` is set verbatim to the overlay text — never merged
  //                   with an existing value, since this is a dedicated single-purpose var, not a
  //                   shared config channel like `externalMcpInjection`'s env-content strategies.
  //                   Delivered on every turn like `append-flag` (an env var read at spawn time is
  //                   no more "stored history" than an argv flag is), and with no capability gate:
  //                   an unrecognized env var is inert to a CLI, not a fatal "unknown option".
  //
  //   'config-instructions-file' — the CLI reads a config document's `instructions` array (file
  //                   paths or remote URLs — never inline text; confirmed live an inline string is
  //                   silently ignored) and appends each file's content to its own defaults, never
  //                   replacing them (`opencode` — see `defs/opencode.ts`'s own doc for the full
  //                   live-verification transcript: honored, append-not-replace, and coexists with
  //                   the `mcp` key the same document may already carry, all confirmed against a
  //                   real installed CLI, not inferred from docs). `varName` names the env var
  //                   carrying the config document (the SAME var `externalMcpInjection`'s
  //                   `'*-env-content'` strategies use — duplicated here rather than cross-read from
  //                   that field, so this strategy stays self-contained: a def wanting this
  //                   mechanism without also using the MCP env-content strategy needs no unrelated
  //                   declaration just to make the dispatch work). The daemon stages the overlay to
  //                   a temp file per run (an inline string will not do — see above) and merges its
  //                   path into the array, never clobbering an existing entry (`@jini-ai/daemon`'s
  //                   `mergeEnvContentInstructions`, mirroring `mergeEnvContentMcpConfig`'s "merge,
  //                   never clobber" discipline for the sibling `mcp` key in the same document).
  //                   Delivered on every turn like `append-flag`/`env-var` — confirmed live that
  //                   `instructions` is re-read fresh from the env on every spawn, even a
  //                   `-s <id>`-resumed turn, so nothing here is ever baked into the CLI's own
  //                   persisted session state.
