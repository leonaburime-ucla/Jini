// `agy` v1.0.3 still has no `--model` flag (upstream issue #35), but the
// TUI's Switch-Model picker writes the choice to its settings.json, and
// every `agy -p` invocation re-reads that file on startup — verified by
// capturing the `--log-file` line `Propagating selected model override to
// backend: label="<model>"`. So we can route OD's model picker through
// settings.json: when the user picks a concrete model in Settings, the
// daemon writes the label into agy's settings.json right before spawn,
// and the resulting print-mode run uses that model.
//
// Two ids the picker exposes are special:
//   - 'default'         : leave settings.json untouched, so agy keeps
//                         whatever the user last picked in its own TUI.
//                         (Respects user choice when they switch models
//                         from `agy` directly.)
//   - any other id      : the literal display label agy expects (e.g.
//                         "Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)", "Claude Sonnet 4.6
//                         (Thinking)"). We persist it before spawn.
//
// `supportsCustomModel: false` because the label set is a server-side
// enum — a typed id agy doesn't recognise resolves to a silent
// `availableModels` cache miss + empty print-mode output, which surfaces
// to the user as a generic "empty response" error.
//
// The 8 model labels mirror what `Switch Model` in agy's TUI lists for
// consumer-tier accounts as of 2026-05-28. The set is small and stable
// enough to ship statically until upstream adds a programmatic
// `agy models` subcommand (also tracked under issue #35).
