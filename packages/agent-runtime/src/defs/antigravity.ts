// `agy` v1.1.24 has a real `--model <id>` flag (`agy --help`: "Model for the current CLI
// session") plus a machine-readable `agy models` subcommand that lists every selectable model as
// a stable `<slug>\t<label>` pair — both verified live, neither true of the v1.0.3 this file used
// to target (upstream issue #35, closed by the flag's addition). That retires the
// settings.json-write-then-poll-the-log workaround this file used to carry (see git history for
// `writeAntigravityModelSelection`/`antigravityModelLock`/`waitForAgyToReadModel`, and the
// process-global race across concurrent runs it existed to serialize): the model rides argv on
// `buildArgs` below instead, exactly like every other flag this def emits, and there is nothing
// left to lock.
//
// Two cases `buildArgs` treats specially:
//   - `DEFAULT_MODEL_OPTION.id` ('default') or no model at all: omit `--model` entirely, so agy
//     keeps whatever it would otherwise default to (its own TUI's last pick, or its own default).
//   - any other id: one of the stable slugs below (e.g. `gemini-3.1-pro-high`), passed verbatim as
//     `--model`'s value.
//
// `supportsCustomModel: false` because the model set is still a server-side enum, not free text —
// but the failure mode for an id outside it changed for the better: `agy --model <bogus> -p ...`
// now prints a loud `Error: invalid model selection ...` plus the full list of valid models
// (verified live), rather than the old settings.json path's silent `availableModels` cache miss +
// empty print-mode output. Kept `false` anyway: nothing here validates a typed id before spawn, so
// letting a UI send arbitrary text would just move that same failure into production instead of
// preventing it — `isKnownModel` (`../models.ts`) is what actually gates a caller-supplied id
// against this list before it ever reaches `buildArgs`.
//
// The 14 slugs/labels below are `agy models`' full live output as of agy v1.1.24 (2026-09-02), not
// a hand-maintained guess — re-run `agy models` to refresh if upstream's catalog changes.

// `agy -p` prints an interactive OAuth sign-in URL to **stdout** and then
// exits **0** when the keyring entry is missing or expired, so a driver that
// streams stdout live shows that URL to the user as if it were the model's
// reply. Two reasons that is a leak, not merely ugly:
//   - the URL carries the client_id and redirect_uri of a login flow bound to
//     whoever runs the daemon, and a chat transcript is a far wider audience
//     than a terminal;
//   - it is also useless to click: `-p` print mode has no field to paste the
//     resulting auth code back into (see `auth.ts`'s
//     `antigravityAuthGuidance`), so the only outcome is a leaked URL.
// Hence `stdoutPolicy: {buffering: 'until-close'}` plus this redactor.
//
// The shape being matched is real, not guessed — it is the same text this
// package's own `isAntigravityAuthFailureText` already classifies, captured
// from agy v1.0.3:
//   Authentication required. Please visit the URL to log in:

  // `externalMcpInjection: 'env-passthrough'` — the prior verdict here ("no safe, run-scoped
  // delivery mechanism exists") stood as long as the only candidates were a per-run config
  // flag/relocatable home dir, neither of which `agy` has (see the probes below, still accurate).
  // What flips the verdict is a THIRD property, verified live and not previously tested: `agy`
  // passes its own parent process environment through to the stdio MCP server children it spawns
  // for servers already sitting in its persistent global registry.
  //
  //   - Proven with a probe MCP server registered under a relocated `HOME`'s
  //     `.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`: booted under `agy -p`, it read a marker variable
  //     (`TOVU_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_PROBE`) straight out of its own `process.env` — no config field, no
  //     argv, nothing but inherited environment. Full MCP handshake observed on the same run:
  //     `server/discover` → `initialize` → `notifications/initialized` → `tools/list`
  //     (protocolVersion `2025-11-25`, clientInfo `antigravity-client`).
  //   - That makes the registration itself a STATIC, one-time operation — the operator adds one
  //     `tovu` entry to their real `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (confirmed still the one real
  //     mechanism; see the probes below) with a bare, env-free `command` pointing at this package's
  //     own `jini-mcp` bin, resolving its credential from the environment at spawn time instead of
  //     a baked-in value. No per-spawn config mutation, no lock, no restore discipline — the exact
  //     "safe, run-scoped delivery" gap the old verdict cited is closed by inheritance, not by
  //     relocation.
  //   - So this def's job shrinks to exactly what `'env-passthrough'` describes in `types.ts`: put
  //     the bridge entry's `JINI_RUN_ID`/`JINI_DAEMON_URL`/`JINI_DAEMON_TOKEN` onto `agy`'s OWN
  //     spawn env (done centrally by `@jini-ai/daemon`'s `computeChildEnv`, not by this def's
  //     `buildArgs`), and `agy` carries them the rest of the way to the already-registered server on
  //     its own.
  //
  // The prior probes into a per-run/relocatable mechanism remain accurate and are kept as the
  // record of what does NOT work, so a future reader does not re-walk the same dead ends:
  //
  //   - No per-run config-path flag. `agy --help` and `agy mcp add --help` were read in full: `mcp
  //     add/remove/list/enable/disable` only mutate the PERSISTENT global registry — there is no
  //     `--mcp-config <path>`-shaped flag anywhere on the top-level command or its subcommands.
  //   - No CODEX_HOME-equivalent env var. `strings` over the `agy` binary itself (not just docs) for
  //     every all-caps `*HOME*`/`*_DIR`/`*_PATH`/`XDG_*` token found nothing naming a relocatable
  //     config/data root for Antigravity or Gemini specifically — only the generic `HOME` (relocating
  //     that would redirect the ENTIRE user profile for the child, not a scoped config dir, and is not
  //     an "explicit, run-scoped delivery" by any reasonable reading). Also why the passthrough probe
  //     above used a relocated `HOME` only to prove inheritance in isolation — production spawns
  //     always use the operator's real `HOME`, since relocating it breaks `agy`'s own auth.
  //   - The workspace-relative `.agents/mcp_config.json` this comment used to cite as unverified is
  //     now verified NOT to be what it looked like: a project dir was seeded with a real
  //     `.agents/mcp_config.json` entry, then `agy mcp list` (run from that cwd) showed only the
  //     REAL global config's servers — the workspace file never appeared. A live headless `agy -p`
  //     run from that same cwd (both with and without `--new-project`), captured via `--log-file`,
  //     shows zero mention of "mcp" or the seeded server name anywhere in its diagnostic log, and its
  //     own log line reports the run scoped to a generic `"CLI Project"` bucket, not the cwd as a
  //     distinct project. Best read: `.agents/mcp_config.json` belongs to the Antigravity IDE
  //     extension's own project layer, a different consumer than the bare `agy` CLI binary this
  //     daemon actually spawns — not a mechanism reachable from a plain `agy -p` invocation at all.
  //     Confirmed independently upstream: antigravity-cli issue #60 (open, no maintainer response)
  //     reports the identical "project-local mcp_config.json is read but ignored" symptom.
  //   - `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (global, JSON, `{"mcpServers":{"<name>":{"command":...}}}`,
  //     confirmed by reading the operator's own file read-only after backing it up) has no relocation
  //     path — but per the passthrough finding above, this def never needs to write to it at all
  //     outside the one-time operator registration, so the shared-file race a prior version of this
  //     comment warned about (a second race alongside the now-deleted settings.json model lock) never
  //     materializes: nothing here mutates that file per run.
  //
  // No hang was observed on any of these probes (all completed in well under `--print-timeout`'s
  // default 5m).
