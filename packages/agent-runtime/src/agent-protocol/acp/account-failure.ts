/** @module agent-protocol/acp/account-failure
 * Injection seam for classifying agent-provider account-failure text (auth
 * required, insufficient balance, quota exhausted, etc.) into a structured,
 * actionable error. OD's real implementation classifies vela/AMR-branded
 * failure text against a hardcoded, product-branded recharge URL — that
 * adapter is product-specific and must not live in this package (see
 * source-map.md for the full account of what was left behind and why).
 * Callers inject their own `AccountFailureClassifier` through
 * `AttachAcpSessionOptions.accountFailureClassifier`; the default
 * `noopAccountFailureClassifier` always returns `null`, which reproduces the
 * behavior of not having this feature at all — no promotion ever fires.
 * Depends on nothing; consumed by acp/updates.ts and acp/session.ts.
