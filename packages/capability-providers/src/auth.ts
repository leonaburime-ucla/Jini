/**
 * `AuthProvider` — a swappable identity/session port. Speculative
 * port-design exploration (see `source-map.md`): Zana and Tovu-Runner each
 * independently built an explicit capability-provider layer with auth as one
 * of the swappable capabilities (Supabase/sqlite-backed) — this is the
 * engine-level shape that convergence points at, not a lift from either.
 *
 * This file defines only the port's stable interface/type surface — safe to
 * import from the normal `@jini/capability-providers` entry point. The
 * in-memory reference implementation (`createInMemoryAuthProvider`) is a
 * non-cryptographic, non-production stub and lives under
 * `src/unsafe-reference/`, exported only from the separate
 * `@jini/capability-providers/unsafe-reference` entry point — see that
 * directory's `index.ts` header for the full warning.
