/**
 * @module useComposer
 *
 * Owns the composer's draft text, staged attachments, `@`-mention popover
 * state, and the selected agent/model/sessionMode. Per
 * `foundry/docs/jini-port/recon/r4b-webui-design.md` §4: attachments reach the host
 * only through `ProjectContextValue.uploadFiles`/`ComposerSlots`; no direct
 * provider import. Draft persistence (OD's `ComposerDraftPort`,
 * localStorage-backed) is likewise injectable, not hard-wired — this hook
 * never touches `localStorage` itself; a host that wants persistence passes
 * `persistence` (falling back to in-memory/no persistence when omitted).
 *
 * Origin pattern: OD's `features/chat-composer/hooks/useComposerDraft.hooks.ts`
 * + `useComposerUpload.hooks.ts` + `useMentionPopover.hooks.ts` (branch
 * `refactor/web-chat-composer-slice-pr`), generalized: the Lexical-editor-ref
 * plumbing and localStorage port are OD/DOM-specific and dropped; the
 * draft/attachment/mention/agent-selection *state shape* is kept.
