 * @module delegated-tools
 *
 * `POST /api/delegated-tool-calls` — the daemon-side half of gap 3's MCP-callback continuation
 * transport spike (see `packages/daemon/source-map.md`'s "run/chat orchestration gap 3, part 1"
 * addition and this package's own dated section in `source-map.md`). The swarm-consensus Final
 * Recommendation asked for exactly this round trip: "inject the already-shipped MCP host into
 * one MCP-capable CLI's launch config, prove a tool round-trip through the existing
 * `delegated-tool-bridge.ts`." This route is that round trip's daemon-side half — an MCP server
 * subprocess spawned alongside a `claude` run (`packages/mcp/src/bin/serve.ts`, injected via
 * `packages/daemon/src/agent-executor.ts`'s optional `mcpJsonInjection` config) calls back into
 * the daemon over loopback HTTP (`packages/mcp/src/server/daemon-client.ts`) with
 * `{runId, toolUseId, toolId, input}`; this route decodes that request and calls the
 * already-shipped, already-tested `createDelegatedToolBridge`
 * (`packages/daemon/src/delegated-tool-bridge.ts`), which is the ONLY execution path from here:
 * every injected byte still routes through `ToolExecutor`'s deny-by-default gate — no parallel
 * authorization mechanism is introduced by this route.
 *
 * `resolvePrincipal` is host-owned and has no default (mirrors gap 3's own resolved
 * human-in-the-loop answer — an explicit host-supplied allowlist/policy, never an invented
 * mechanism): whatever `Principal` a host resolves for a given delegated-tool-call request is
 * exactly what flows into `ToolExecutor.execute`'s own `ToolPolicy.authorize`/
 * `ExecutionDelegate` gates. This route does not itself decide who is allowed to do what — it
 * only decides *which run* a request may act against (an unknown or not-yet-started `runId` is
 * rejected with `404` before the bridge is ever invoked, same precedent as `runs.ts`'s
 * `runCancelRoute`).
