/**
 * @module attachments
 *
 * `POST /api/attachments`, `DELETE /api/attachments` — an HTTP route pack for user file/image
 * uploads staged for one agent run, over a narrow, transport-owned `AttachmentStore` port plus a
 * batteries-included disk implementation (`createDiskAttachmentStore`).
 *
 * **The capability this closes.** A chat composer that accepts drag-and-drop needs somewhere to put
 * the bytes, a way to hand the agent a path it is actually allowed to read, and a guarantee that
 * those bytes disappear when the run ends. That is three separate concerns (an upload endpoint, a
 * trusted-metadata registry, and a run-scoped lifetime) which every host would otherwise hand-roll.
 * This module owns all three; `@jini-ai/chat-react`'s `createDaemonAttachmentUploader` is the
 * matching client half.
 *
 * **Trust model.** A renderer supplies bytes, a filename, and a batch id. None of that is trusted:
 * - the filename is reduced to a basename over a conservative character allowlist
 *   (`sanitizeAttachmentName`) and is only ever used as *display* text plus a short extension
 *   suffix — never as the stored filename, which is a fresh `randomUUID()`;
 * - the `kind` (`'image' | 'file'`) is sniffed from the leading bytes (`detectAttachmentKind`),
 *   never taken from a renderer-controlled MIME type or file extension;
 * - the byte count is measured while streaming, never read from a client-supplied length;
 * - the returned `path` is an opaque `attachment:<uuid>` capability id, not a filesystem path, so a
 *   renderer never learns where the upload root is and cannot name a file it did not upload.
 *   `claim()` is what exchanges those ids for real paths, server-side.
 *
 * **What `claim()` guarantees.** Exactly once per registered attachment, and only if the file is
 * still the same file: `lstat` must report a regular non-symlink whose `dev`/`ino`/`size` match
 * what was recorded at registration, and `realpath` must equal the recorded path (so neither the
 * file nor any parent directory was swapped for a symlink between upload and run start). Every
 * claimed attachment must belong to one batch, so the single `batchDirectory` a host grants the
 * agent read access to cannot be widened by mixing batches.
 *
 * **Storage lifetime is daemon-lifetime, not persistent.** `createDiskAttachmentStore` empties its
 * upload directory on construction: files left behind by an interrupted previous process cannot be
 * authenticated against an in-memory registry that no longer exists, so they are removed rather
 * than adopted. Unclaimed uploads also expire by TTL (`pruneExpired`), and a run's claimed files are
 * deleted by `cleanupRun`.
 *
 * **This pack does not auto-wire itself into a run's lifecycle**, because no generic hook for that
 * exists — the same deliberate choice `@jini-ai/daemon`'s `createRunScopedContextStore` makes. A
 * host claims in its own `onRunStarted` and cleans up in a `finally`, roughly:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const store = await createDiskAttachmentStore({ uploadDirectory });
 * // ... httpExtensions: [(app, { adapter }) => registerAttachmentRoutes(app, { store }, adapter)]
 * onRunStarted: (context) => {
 *   void (async () => {
 *     try {
 *       const claimed = await store.claim(attachmentRefsFrom(context.request), context.run.id);
 *       await executor.run({
 *         runId: context.run.id,
 *         // ... prompt, cwd, agentId
 *         ...(claimed.batchDirectory === undefined ? {} : {
 *           imagePaths: claimed.attachments.filter((a) => a.kind === 'image').map((a) => a.path),
 *           extraAllowedDirs: [claimed.batchDirectory],
 *           uploadRoot: claimed.batchDirectory,
 *         }),
 *       });
 *     } finally {
 *       await store.cleanupRun(context.run.id);
 *     }
 *   })();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `imagePaths`/`extraAllowedDirs`/`uploadRoot` are pre-existing `AgentExecutor.run()` options; this
 * module only produces real values for them.
 *
 * **Body-parser ordering (`POST` reads the raw request stream).** The upload route streams
 * `request` straight to disk, so any body-parsing middleware that has already consumed the stream
 * leaves nothing to write. The classic way to hit this is a JSON body parser mounted app-wide: a
 * user drops a `.json` file, the browser sets `content-type: application/json`, and
 * `express.json()` eats the body — which without a guard shows up as the deeply unhelpful
 * "attachment is empty". `registerAttachmentRoutes` detects an already-consumed stream up front and
 * reports it as a host misconfiguration (`'attachment-body-consumed'`) instead of failing silently.
 * Mount this pack before any global body parser, or scope the parser so it skips this path.
 *
 * **SEC-005 redaction**: a store failure can carry filesystem paths a caller must not see, so
 * anything that is not an explicitly-classified `AttachmentRejectedError` becomes a
 * correlation-id-bearing generic `INTERNAL_ERROR`, with the real error reaching a host-owned sink —
 * the same `reportInternalError` shape `media.ts`/`delegated-tools.ts` use.
