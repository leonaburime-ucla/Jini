 * `respondToUploadFailure`, and `delegated-tools.ts`'s `errorKind: 'validation'` split on
 * `ToolExecutionResult`, both exist because nothing at THIS layer distinguished "the code that threw
 * already classified this as caller-safe" from "something unanticipated happened" — so a route with
 * no such local carve-out has no way to disclose even a deliberately-safe failure, and everything it
 * throws redacts identically to a stray filesystem or driver error.
 *
 * Prefer returning `err(apiError)` from `handle` when the failure is anticipated at that point —
 * that path already reaches the caller with full fidelity and never touches this catch at all. This
 * class exists for the same kind of failure discovered a level deeper: inside an awaited call
 * `handle` itself did not (or could not) wrap in its own `try`.
 *
 * Not a way to defeat SEC-005: the only way to reach the branch that reads this class is for code to
 * construct one itself, naming the exact `ApiError` — code and message — it is choosing to disclose.
 * Any thrown value that is not this class (including a plain `Error` with an actionable-looking
 * message) still redacts exactly as before; nothing here widens what a route can leak by accident.
