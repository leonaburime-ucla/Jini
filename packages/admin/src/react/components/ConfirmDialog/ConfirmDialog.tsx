/**
 * @file Shared modal confirmation primitive — the replacement for `window.confirm`, which blocks
 * the whole tab, cannot carry destructive-vs-neutral styling, and reads as a browser artifact
 * rather than part of the product.
 *
 * Built on the native `<dialog>` element (`showModal()`/`close()`) rather than a plain-`<div>`
 * overlay + backdrop idiom: that shape hand-rolls focus trapping, Escape handling, and a backdrop
 * element, all of which the browser's own top layer gives a real `<dialog>` for free, including
 * correct stacking above everything else on the page without a chosen `z-index`. The `showModal`/
 * `close` calls themselves, and the jsdom fallback they need, live in `ConfirmDialog.hooks.tsx` —
 * see that file's doc comment.
 *
 * Unstyled, like everything in this layer: the `.confirm-dialog` / `.btn-secondary` /
 * `.btn-danger` / `.btn-warning` class names are emitted for the host stylesheet to define.
 *
 * ## Agent handles
 *
 * Given `agentHandle="delete-role"` this publishes:
 *
 * | element | handle | role |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | the confirm action | `delete-role-confirm` | `button` |
 * | the cancel/dismiss action | `delete-role-cancel` | `button` |
 *
 * Both segments are literals this component chooses itself, never host data — unlike `RowMenu`'s
 * per-item keys (arbitrary host strings that can collide after slugifying), `confirm`/`cancel`
 * need no sanitizing. `agentHandle` itself is NOT sanitized either: it is the caller's own explicit
 * choice of name, and a bad one should fail loudly at first render rather than silently answer to a
 * handle the caller never wrote. Omit `agentHandle` and no `data-agent-*` markup is emitted at all.
 *
 * Both handles are present in the DOM as soon as `agentHandle` is supplied, regardless of `open` —
 * this component stays mounted and toggles the native `<dialog>`'s open state rather than being
 * conditionally rendered by its caller (see `useConfirmDialog`'s doc comment), so there is no
 * "closed" render that omits them, the same reasoning `RowMenu`'s always-visible trigger handle
 * documents for itself.
 *
 * This component renders no typed-confirmation input today (no "type DELETE to confirm" field) —
 * if one is added later it needs its own handle under this same scheme (e.g. `<base>-confirm-input`,
 * role `field`).
 *
 * Labels state both the action and its consequence tier, derived from this component's own
 * three-tier `ConfirmTone` vocabulary rather than reparsed from `title`/`body`: `body` is arbitrary
 * `ReactNode` (a caller can pass JSX), not guaranteed to be a string at all, so it cannot be safely
 * folded into agent-facing text — see {@link confirmDialogConsequencePhrase}.
