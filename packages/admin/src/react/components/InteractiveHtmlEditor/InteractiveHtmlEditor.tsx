 * @file Tovu-specific composition of `@jini-ai/ui/html-editor`'s generic `InteractiveHtmlEditor`: a
 * Page's `body_html` (the first caller — see `Tovu/apps/admin/src/features/pages/PageEditor.tsx`)
 * can carry `<div data-embed-type="…" data-embed-id="…"></div>` placeholders (and the legacy
 * `data-widget-embed`/`data-form-embed` attributes on migration-era rows) that a separate scanner
 * (`Tovu/src/widgets/html-embeds.ts`) resolves at render time — that scanner requires the div to
 * stay exactly empty and self-closing, and degrades silently, with no error, the moment anything is
 * written inside one. The CURRENT convention has since moved to a single `data-embed-config`
 * attribute carrying a JSON payload (`Tovu/src/core/embeds/marker.ts`); `isProtectedEmbedElement`
 * below has not been updated to recognize it (tracked separately — see that function's own doc), but
 * `describeEmbedPlaceholder` below IS built against the current convention, since it only needs to
 * read the marker, not police edits to it.
 *
 * The generic `@jini-ai/ui` primitive has zero knowledge of either convention; this file is the thin
 * adapter that supplies them as an `isProtectedElement` predicate and a `describeEmbedPlaceholder`
 * labeler, so `PageEditor.tsx` can keep importing `InteractiveHtmlEditor` from `@jini-ai/admin/react`
 * unchanged.

 *
 *  **Does NOT include `data-embed-config`, the CURRENT marker attribute** (`Tovu/src/core/embeds/
 *  marker.ts`) — a known, separately-tracked gap: an embed marker written the current way is still
 *  editable/draggable/removable in this editor today. Left alone here deliberately (out of scope for
 *  the placeholder-card feature this file's `describeEmbedPlaceholder` was added for); widening this
 *  list to close that gap is a one-line fix (`'data-embed-config'` added below) but changes real

/**
 * Friendly card headings for every embed `type` value this codebase names anywhere, split into two
 * groups (traced against `Tovu/src/server/http/site/render.ts`'s `renderHtmlPageBody`/`isPageEmbedType`
 * at the owner's own request, 2026-08-25 — authoritative, not re-derived):
 *
 * - **`media`, `widget`, `post`, `content`** — the ONLY four types `isPageEmbedType` (gating
 *   `renderHtmlPageBody`, `render.ts:1238`) accepts, i.e. the complete set a Page's `body_html` — what
 *   this editor edits — can ever actually contain. These are the types an operator can realistically
 *   hit in the Interactive tab.
 * - **`partial`, `menu`** — `Tovu/src/widgets/resolver-service.ts`'s `THEME_OWNED_MARKER_TYPES`. NOT
 *   reachable inside a Page body — they live in THEME TEMPLATES (site header/nav/footer), authored
 *   outside this editor entirely, so this component should not grow UI affordances assuming one can
 *   appear here. Labeled anyway (rather than left to the generic fallback below) purely so the ONE
 *   defensive case — a future change routes theme markup through this same editor, or a marketplace
 *   theme's template gets opened here by mistake — still reads as a real word instead of a raw string.
 *
 * **`media` covers BOTH images and video — one type, one label, by design.** `resolveMediaTypeEmbeds`
 * (`resolver-service.ts`) resolves a `media` marker to either a bare `<img>` or `<video>` tag depending
 * on the asset's own kind, but that distinction lives entirely server-side in the resolved OUTPUT, not
 * in the marker's `data-embed-config` this function reads. Telling them apart here would need either a
 * new server endpoint (out of scope — see `identityLabel`'s doc on the identical media-title tradeoff)
 * or guessing from the id string, which is not a real signal and would be actively misleading if wrong.
 * "Media" stays correct for both until a cheap, real signal exists.
 *
 * Matched lower-cased — see `identityLabel`'s doc and `core/embeds/marker.ts`'s own `toEmbedRef` for
 * why the server-side scanner lower-cases `type` the same way. An unregistered type is not an error
 * here (unlike a rejected/unparseable marker) — `type` is deliberately a free string end-to-end (see
 * `Tovu/src/widgets/html-embeds.ts`'s file header) precisely so a new one (a marketplace theme
 * introducing its own, say) never requires a matching change on this list AND never renders nothing —
 * `titleCase` below covers it with a still-legible generic card instead of a blank/thrown result.

 * id filter or pagination, just to answer one id's `title`. Adding a `GET /media/:id` route is out of
 * this feature's scope (an editor-chrome label is not worth a new server endpoint), and reusing
 * `listMedia()` here would mean an async network call — with its own loading/error/unmount-race
