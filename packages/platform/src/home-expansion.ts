/**
 * @module home-expansion
 *
 * Shared shorthand-expander for env-supplied directory paths. Any port that
 * resolves a data/config directory from an environment variable (sandbox
 * roots, resource paths, …) should route through this so a launcher passing
 * `$HOME/.myapp` always lands at the same expanded path regardless of which
 * port did the resolving.
 *
 * Recognized shorthands (case-sensitive):
 *   '~'        | '~/...'   | '~\\...'
 *   '$HOME'    | '$HOME/...' | '$HOME\\...'
 *   '${HOME}'  | '${HOME}/...' | '${HOME}\\...'
 *
 * Anything else (absolute paths, plain relative paths, $OTHER variables) is
 * returned unchanged. Both forward and back slashes are accepted in the
 * prefix so a Windows launcher passing `$HOME\.myapp` behaves the same as a
 * Unix launcher passing `$HOME/.myapp`; the result is rebuilt via
 * `path.join` so the platform separator is correct in the output regardless
 * of which the input used.
