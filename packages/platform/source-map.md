# `@jini/platform` — provenance

Origin: `nexu-io/open-design` (fork `leonaburime-ucla/open-design`), branch `main`,
commit `951fa5f1541c3b7af23ccb07e3e60b294def56b1` (2026-07-12), local reference
clone `/Users/la/Desktop/Programming/OSS-Repos/open-design-agentic`.

Per extraction-plan.md §8 task 4: "`@jini/platform` + `@jini/sidecar` verbatim,
path-mirrored + patch-router." This package is the low-risk mechanical half of
that task — OS/process/file/http/proxy/toolchain primitives with no OD domain
nouns to strip, unlike `@jini/protocol` (task 2), which needed heavy content
stripping.

| Jini file | Origin file | Transform |
|---|---|---|
| `src/command.ts` | `packages/platform/src/command.ts` | Verbatim. Cross-platform command-invocation construction (Windows `.bat`/`.cmd` shim quoting, package-manager re-entry). No OD nouns; only relative import paths preserved as-is (no sibling imports in this file). |
| `src/process.ts` | `packages/platform/src/process.ts` | Verbatim. Process stamp encode/decode, spawn/stop helpers, process-tree walk, POSIX/Windows snapshot enumeration. Imports `./command.js` unchanged (same relative path, now resolving inside `@jini/platform`). |
| `src/proxy-env.ts` | `packages/platform/src/proxy-env.ts` | Ported with 3 minimal type-strictness edits only (no behavior change) — see "Strictness-only edits" below. System proxy discovery (macOS `scutil`, Windows registry) and proxy-aware env merging; no OD nouns. |
| `src/fs.ts` | `packages/platform/src/fs.ts` | Verbatim. Path containment, atomic copy, best-effort removal, log-tail reads. No OD nouns. |
| `src/http.ts` | `packages/platform/src/http.ts` | Verbatim. HTTP readiness polling (`waitForHttpOk`). No OD nouns. |
| `src/toolchain.ts` | `packages/platform/src/toolchain.ts` | Ported with 1 identity-strip (comment only) + 1 type-strictness edit — see below. User-level toolchain bin discovery (npm/pnpm/bun/cargo/deno/go/pyenv prefixes, asdf/volta/mise/nvm/fnm shims, per-version Node roots). Business logic (which dirs to search) kept verbatim — it is generic to any GUI-launched Node daemon, not OD-specific. |
| `src/index.ts` | `packages/platform/src/index.ts` | Ported with 1 identity-strip (module doc comment) — see below. Root barrel; re-exports the same public surface under the same names. |

## Identity strips (per root `AGENTS.md` hard boundary: no `Open Design`/`OD_`/`--od-stamp`/`/tmp/open-design` in `packages/@jini/**`)

| File | Origin | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/index.ts` | `@module @open-design/platform` | → `@module @jini/platform` | Module doc comment named the OD package; renamed to the Jini package, no behavior change. |
| `src/toolchain.ts` | comment: `"...they resolve cleanly from the user's shell. See open-design issue #442."` | Dropped the `See open-design issue #442` sentence; kept the rest of the rationale comment. | Named the origin product and a product-specific issue tracker reference. The underlying rationale (why `~/.npm-global`/`~/.npm-packages` are searched) is generic and was kept. |

## Strictness-only edits (Jini's stricter `tsconfig.base.json`, no behavior change)

Jini's root `tsconfig.base.json` sets `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, which OD's
own `tsconfig.json` does not set. This surfaces `string | undefined` on regex
match-group and fixed-length-tuple index access that OD's compiler didn't flag.
Fixed with non-null assertions at call sites where the surrounding logic already
guarantees the value is present (a successful regex match with a mandatory
capture group; a tuple index bounded by the tuple's own `.length`):

- `src/proxy-env.ts`: `parseMacosScutilProxyOutput`'s exception-list/scalar regex
  captures (`match[1]!`, `match[2]!`) and `parseRegistryValue`'s capture
  (`match[1]!`).
- `src/toolchain.ts`: `compareVersionLikeDirNames`'s tuple index comparison
  (`rightSemver[index]!`, `leftSemver[index]!`).

No other files needed strictness edits.

## Dependencies

No runtime dependencies in the origin package (devDependencies only: `@types/node`,
`esbuild`, `typescript`, `vitest` — all build/test tooling). `@types/node` was added
to the Jini repo root `package.json` devDependencies (not previously present) since
`@jini/protocol` is pure-TypeScript and never needed Node type declarations; this is
the first engine package that touches `node:*` builtins.

## Not ported (out of scope for this task)

Nothing was left out — every file in the origin `packages/platform/src/` ported
(verbatim or with the identity/strictness edits above). The origin `tests/`
directory (`tests/index.test.ts`, `tests/process-tree.test.ts`,
`tests/stamp-read.test.ts`, ~1216+41+78 lines) was not ported verbatim; `src/index.test.ts`
here is a fresh vitest suite exercising the same real exported surface (command
invocation, process stamp round-trip/match, process-tree collection, fs atomic
copy/removal/log-tail, http polling, proxy-env parse/merge, toolchain bin
discovery) rather than a line-for-line port of OD's larger fixture suite.

## Explicitly deferred (task 1 dependency)

The "patch-router" half of task 4's gate ("a real historical `packages/platform`
patch routes cleanly") depends on task 1 (harnesses + sync-ownership manifest),
which has not been done yet. Not attempted here — see the Programmer handoff
report for this task.
