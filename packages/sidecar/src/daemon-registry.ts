/**
 * @module daemon-registry
 *
 * A local daemon "where am I listening" registry: a small, atomically-written JSON pointer
 * file recording a running daemon's URL/host/port/pid, plus a liveness-checked reader so a
 * separate process (e.g. a CLI invocation) can discover it without trusting a stale record
 * left behind by a daemon that crashed rather than shutting down cleanly. Built on this
 * package's own `json-file.ts` (atomic write, forgiving read, guarded pointer removal) — the
 * exact primitives OD's sidecar already uses for its own `current.json` namespace pointer
 * (see `paths.ts`'s `resolvePointerPath`) — plus a new `isProcessAlive` liveness probe no
 * existing module in this package needed before. Depends on `node:path` and this package's
 * own `json-file.ts`.
