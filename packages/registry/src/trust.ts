/**
 * @module trust
 *
 * A real (not config-asserted) verifier for `RegistryEntry.signatures[]`
 * (`@jini/protocol`'s `RegistrySignatureSchema`), closing the still-open half
 * of SEC-RB-005 per
 * `ADS-memory/reports/proposals/PROP-registry-signature-trust-verification-2026-07-21.md`
 * and its follow-up sign-off: v1 supports exactly one signature `kind`,
 * `'github-oidc'` — `'cosign'`/`'minisign'`/`'custom'` are recognized but
 * always report `verified: false` with an explicit "unsupported kind"
 * reason, never silently pass and never throw.
 *
 * ## What `github-oidc` actually verifies
 *
 * A GitHub Actions OIDC *ID token* (a short-lived JWT, `iss:
 * https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, `exp` typically minutes in
 * the future) cannot itself be the durable, at-rest proof stored in
 * `RegistryEntry.signatures[]` — a registry entry is resolved and re-checked
 * long after it was signed, and a raw ID token would already be expired by
 * then. This is exactly why GitHub's own recommended mechanism for durable
 * artifact provenance ("Artifact Attestations",
 * `docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/publish-artifacts/verify-artifact-attestations-with-cli`)
 * is Sigstore-style **keyless signing**: the short-lived OIDC token is used
 * once, at signing time, to obtain a short-lived Fulcio-issued X.509
 * certificate whose Subject Alternative Name (SAN) encodes the OIDC
 * identity (e.g. a GitHub Actions workflow ref); that certificate's public
 * key then verifies a signature that remains checkable indefinitely. This
 * matches `RegistrySignatureSchema`'s own shape (`certificate` alongside
 * `signature`/`issuer`/`subject`/`signedAt`) far better than a raw JWT would
 * — the schema already models "signature + the cert that proves who made
 * it," not "a bearer token." So `kind: 'github-oidc'` here means: a
 * Sigstore/Fulcio-style keyless signature, cryptographically verified
 * end-to-end by this module.
 *
 * ## What this module deliberately does NOT do (v1 scope)
 *
 * - **No Sigstore transparency-log (Rekor) inclusion-proof verification.**
 *   Real Sigstore verifiers don't trust "is this short-lived cert valid
 *   *right now*" (it never is, days/weeks after signing) — they trust "was
 *   there a Rekor log entry, with an independent timestamp, proving the
 *   signature existed while the cert was valid." This module instead trusts
 *   the signature's own self-reported `signedAt` field against the
 *   certificate's validity window (see {@link verifyRegistrySignature}) —
 *   `signedAt` is NOT independently attested by a timestamp authority in
 *   v1. A host that needs that guarantee should not rely on this alone.
 * - **No Sigstore public-good root/TUF auto-discovery.** This module never
 *   hardcodes or fetches Sigstore's public Fulcio root — the host explicitly
 *   supplies the CA certificate(s) to trust via
 *   {@link GithubOidcTrustRoot.caCertificates} (which may be Sigstore's
 *   public root, a GitHub Enterprise private Fulcio-equivalent root, or any
 *   other CA the host chooses to trust). No network calls are made by this
 *   module.
 * - **No revocation checking (CRL/OCSP).** Fulcio-style short-lived certs
 *   are designed around expiry, not revocation, matching Sigstore's own
 *   documented model.
 * - **No Fulcio-specific custom-OID extension parsing** (e.g. the
 *   `1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.1` OIDC-issuer extension) — Node's built-in
 *   `X509Certificate` has no public API for arbitrary extension OIDs
 *   without a hand-rolled ASN.1 parser. Identity is instead read from the
 *   certificate's `subjectAltName` URI entries (a real, cert-bound value
 *   `X509Certificate` does expose) — see {@link GithubOidcTrustRoot.allowedIdentities}.
 *   The self-reported `signature.issuer`/`signature.subject` wire fields are
 *   checked too, but only as declarative/audit metadata layered on top of
 *   the cert-bound checks below — not the cryptographic root of trust.
 *
 * ## What IS cryptographically real here
 *
 * 1. The certificate chains (via `X509Certificate#checkIssued` +
 *    `X509Certificate#verify`, i.e. an actual signature check, not just a
 *    DN string match) to one of the host-configured
 *    {@link GithubOidcTrustRoot.caCertificates}.
 * 2. `signature.signature` is a real cryptographic signature (verified via
 *    `node:crypto`'s `verify()`) over {@link canonicalRegistrySigningPayload},
 *    made with the certificate's own public key.
 * 3. The certificate's `subjectAltName` URI (the cert-bound identity) is
 *    checked against {@link GithubOidcTrustRoot.allowedIdentities}, when
 *    configured.
