/**
 * `@jini/media` — multi-provider image/video/audio generation gateway:

 * async task-tracking port, a host-injected policy port, a generic
 * attachment-staging port, and (as of the dispatch engine) a real
 * multi-vendor REST dispatch engine covering an initial vendor slice — see
 * `source-map.md` for full provenance, exactly which vendors are ported vs
 * deferred, and this package's not-yet-locked status.
