# `@jini/media` — provenance

Origin: `nexu-io/open-design` (fork `leonaburime-ucla/open-design`), branch `main`,
commit `0b88ef5` (2026-07-18 clone), local reference clone `/tmp/od-source`. All 11
files named in the task brief were read in full:

- `apps/daemon/src/media/models.ts` (245 lines)
- `apps/daemon/src/media/config.ts` (grepped in full for exported functions/env
  var names — not read line-by-line beyond that, since it is entirely
  `OD_*`-env/OD-project-path resolution logic explicitly out of scope; see
  "Not ported" below)
- `apps/daemon/src/media/index.ts` (155,475 bytes — the multi-provider REST
  dispatch/execution engine; grepped for its exported surface (`generateMedia`
  is the only top-level export), not read in full — see "Not ported" below)
- `apps/daemon/src/media/policy.ts` (92 lines)
- `apps/daemon/src/media/tasks.ts` (335 lines)

- `apps/daemon/src/media-adapters/types.ts` (116 lines)
- `apps/daemon/src/media-adapters/video.ts` (293 lines)

plus `packages/contracts/src/api/media.ts` (the `MediaExecutionPolicy` type +
`mediaExecutionPolicyDenial` function `policy.ts` wraps — read to recover the
actual generic logic `policy.ts` itself only re-exports).

Per `docs/jini-port/START-HERE.md`/dispatch brief: this is a genuinely new
package — **not in `extraction-plan.md`'s locked §3 package set** (same
situation as `@jini/deploy`, flagged there for the identical reason: named
only in roadmap-appendix-adjacent prose, not in the locked list). This is
added to `AGENTS.md`'s package list flagged as needing Coordinator/
Software-Architect sign-off before it is treated as locked architecture, per
the same precedent `@jini/deploy`'s `source-map.md` set.

## Package map

| Jini file | Origin file(s) | Transform |
|---|---|---|
| `src/types.ts` | `media/models.ts` (catalogue shape: `MediaProvider`, `MediaModel`) + `media-adapters/types.ts` (request-builder shape: `ModelCapability`, `MediaFamily`, `MediaType`, `ExtraBodyParamDef`, `VideoBuildInput`, `BuiltVideoRequest`, `NormalizedVideoResponse`) | Ported near-verbatim — both origin files are already product-neutral (the task brief's own research confirmed `media-adapters` is "a clean, already-generic port"). Fields made `readonly`/arrays `readonly T[]` per this repo's stricter `tsconfig.base.json` conventions (not present in the origin). No OD nouns existed in either source file to strip. |
| `src/providers.ts` | `media/models.ts` (`MEDIA_PROVIDERS`, `IMAGE_MODELS`, `VIDEO_MODELS`, `AUDIO_MODELS_BY_KIND`, `MEDIA_ASPECTS`, `VIDEO_LENGTHS_SEC`, `AUDIO_DURATIONS_SEC`, `findMediaModel`, `findProvider`, `modelsForSurface`) + `media/config.ts`'s `PROVIDER_ENV_CANDIDATES` (de-branded) | The ~25-vendor catalogue (OpenAI, Fal.ai, Leonardo.ai, MiniMax, ElevenLabs, Volcengine, xAI, ...) ported verbatim — every id/label/hint names a real third-party vendor, not an OD concept, so it is reference data under the AGENTS.md product-identity boundary, not a string to strip. Two entries dropped: `codex` provider + `codex-gpt-image-2` model (Codex-CLI-subscription-based auth is an OD-specific local-CLI-login integration, not a REST credential shape any other Jini consumer could use) — flagged explicitly rather than silently omitted. `PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_ENV_VARS` is a **new, de-branded** table: the origin's `PROVIDER_ENV_CANDIDATES` in `config.ts` led every provider with an `OD_*`-prefixed project-scoped override var (e.g. `OD_OPENAI_API_KEY` before `OPENAI_API_KEY`) — that override convention is a host's own project-local-secrets-layer concern, not vendor reference data, so it was dropped; only the generic (non-`OD_`) env var names survive, in the same priority order. One `modelsForSurface` behavior change from the origin: the origin falls back to `AUDIO_MODELS_BY_KIND.music` via `AUDIO_MODELS_BY_KIND[k] \|\| AUDIO_MODELS_BY_KIND.music` (defensive against an unvalidated JS string key); here `audioKind` is a real `AudioKind` union type, so indexing `Record<AudioKind, ...>` is exhaustive and the fallback is genuinely dead code — removed per the coverage-driven-refactor loop's "dead branch → refactor away" rule (Phase 6.5) rather than writing a contrived test to hit an unreachable `??`. |
| `src/capability-registry.ts` | `media-adapters/capabilities.ts` | Verbatim pattern-for-pattern port — the task brief's own prior research already verified this as "a clean, already-generic port." `CapabilityRegistry`'s `get()`/`register()`/`all()` shape, `normalizeModelId`'s `aihubmix-` prefix strip, and the seed-injection design are unchanged. |
| `src/seed.ts` | `media-adapters/seed.ts` | Ported verbatim (real, vendor-call-verified `ModelCapability` reference data). Renamed `AIHUBMIX_VIDEO_SEED` → `MEDIA_CAPABILITY_SEED` — the origin's name ties the *data* to one specific aggregator (AIHubMix) it happened to be sourced through, but the data itself (Seedance/Wan/Sora/Veo/HappyHorse wire behavior) is vendor reference data, not an AIHubMix-owned concept; the rename keeps the package's public surface aggregator-neutral while the file's header comment still documents the AIHubMix provenance. |
| `src/video-request.ts` | `media-adapters/video.ts` | Ported verbatim (pure, transport-free request-shape builder: `resolveWireModel`, `deriveVideoFamily`, `snapDuration`, `snapResolutionToken`, `snapVeoSize`, `snapSizeToSupported`, `buildVideoRequest`, `normalizeVideoResponse`). This wasn't explicitly named in the task brief's four deliverables (types/registry/task-store/policy/catalogue), but it is the direct, equally-generic sibling of `capability-registry.ts` within the same already-generic `media-adapters` layer the brief itself flagged as clean — porting the registry without the request-builder that makes it useful would leave `ModelCapability` data with no consumer in this package. `normalizeVideoResponse` was rewritten (not behaviorally changed) to avoid `any`-typed property chains (`d.data?.id` etc.), since `packages/@jini/**` bans `no-explicit-any` on public surfaces per extraction-plan.md §7 — the origin's optional-chaining fallback logic is preserved exactly, just typed through `Record<string, unknown>` casts instead of implicit `any`. |
| `src/task-store.ts` | `media/tasks.ts` | **Generalized, not lifted** — the origin is a synchronous `better-sqlite3` CRUD module (raw SQL schema, `db.prepare(...).run(...)`) keyed on `projectId` (an OD domain noun) with a hand-written JSON-column serialization layer. Per extraction-plan.md §2.6 ("ports are async-only from day one") and the precedent `@jini/daemon`'s `EventLog` already set (`packages/daemon/src/event-log.ts`: a port interface + `createInMemoryEventLog` reference implementation, no SQL), this is a from-scratch `MediaTaskStore` port + `createInMemoryMediaTaskStore` reference implementation reproducing the same lifecycle semantics: `queued→running→done\|failed\|interrupted` status machine, `listByOwner`'s terminal-status filtering (renamed from `listMediaTasksByProject`; `projectId` → generic `ownerRef`, an opaque host-supplied scoping key — never an OD project id), and `reconcileOnBoot`'s two-phase boot reconciliation (mark in-flight tasks `'interrupted'`, delete terminal tasks past a TTL) ported behaviorally intact from `reconcileMediaTasksOnBoot`. No SQL schema, no `better-sqlite3` dependency in this file itself — a durable adapter implementing the same `MediaTaskStore` interface was out of scope for this original pass ("do NOT build a sqlite-backed version, that's a future task"). **Update, 2026-07-21 (dispatch-engine-generalization pass):** that future task is now done — see `src/sqlite-task-store.ts` and the dated section below for `createSqliteMediaTaskStore`, a real `better-sqlite3`-backed adapter, and why it lives in `@jini/media` itself rather than `@jini/sqlite`. |
| `src/policy.ts` | `media/policy.ts` + `packages/contracts/src/api/media.ts` | **Generalized, not lifted.** `media/policy.ts` itself is a thin wrapper re-exporting `@open-design/contracts`'s `MediaExecutionPolicy`/`mediaExecutionPolicyDenial` — reading only that file would have missed the actual logic, so `packages/contracts/src/api/media.ts` was read too. That underlying logic (`mode: 'enabled'\|'disabled'` + optional `allowedSurfaces`/`allowedModels` allowlists, denying with one of three codes) carries **zero OD-specific moderation content or thresholds** — it's a plain gate, confirmed by reading the real function body, not inferred. So it ports as a redefinition: `MediaPolicy` is now a **host-injected port** (`evaluate(target): MediaPolicyDenial \| null`), and `createAllowlistMediaPolicy(policy)` is the reference implementation reproducing the origin's exact gate logic (verbatim behavior, including the "empty array means unrestricted" semantics) — proving the port's shape rather than being the only possible policy a host could wire. A host that needs real content-moderation (NSFW classifiers, per-tenant quotas) implements `MediaPolicy` itself. The doc comment "Run-scoped policy controlling **Open Design**-owned media generation only" was rewritten to drop the product name (per AGENTS.md's product-identity boundary) — the underlying mechanism it describes is unchanged. |
| `src/staging.ts` | `media/amr-image-staging.ts` | **Generalized, not lifted verbatim, despite an unusually clean origin.** The filename and the task brief both flag this as "AMR/vela-vendor-specific," but reading the actual file (77 lines, in full) found **zero AMR/vela coupling in the logic itself** — it is a generic "copy a local file into a staging dir under `cwd`, with root-containment checks and TTL-based pruning" utility; the only OD-specific thing was the hardcoded `.amr-attachments` directory name. Ported as a real, testable `AttachmentStaging` port + `createFsAttachmentStaging` reference implementation (not just an interface — the task brief explicitly allowed either, and a real implementation is more useful and was directly testable). Renamed `stageAmrImagePaths` → `AttachmentStaging.stage`; `STAGING_DIRNAME` (`'.amr-attachments'`, module-level constant) → `stagingDirName` (a per-instance option defaulting to `'.media-attachments'`, so a host can namespace multiple staging areas). `STAGING_MAX_AGE_MS` → `maxAgeMs` option, same default (24h). All logic (root-containment via `path.relative`, prune-by-`mtimeMs`, collision-avoiding `randomUUID()`-prefixed copy, best-effort error swallowing for malformed/missing paths) ported behaviorally intact. |
| `src/tokens.ts` | *(new)* | `CapabilityRegistryToken`/`MediaTaskStoreToken`/`MediaPolicyToken` via `@jini/core`'s `token()` (`packages/core/src/token.ts`), following the exact naming convention `@jini/daemon`'s `src/tokens.ts` already established (bare-interface-name suffixed `Token`, e.g. `RunStoreToken`/`EventLogToken` — not extraction-plan.md §2.2's illustrative bare-name pseudocode, which would shadow the interface names in this codebase's actual precedent). Namespaced `jini.media.*`. |
| `src/index.ts` | *(new — barrel)* | Re-exports all of the above. |

## The dispatch engine (`src/dispatch/`) — added 2026-07-21

`media/index.ts`'s `generateMedia` (the actual multi-provider REST
dispatch/execution engine, 4,055 lines / 155,475 bytes, read in full this
pass — not just grepped) is a genuinely large port: ~20 real vendor
`render*` functions plus shared plumbing. This pass ported the engine core
and an initial, fully-tested vendor slice; the remaining vendors are an
explicit, itemized gap below, not silently dropped — re-implementing all 20
safely in one sitting risks exactly the "getting a real vendor's wire
contract wrong" failure mode the original port brief warned about.

**Boundary redesign (not a verbatim lift):** the origin resolves an OD
`projectId` into a filesystem path and writes bytes there directly
(`ensureProject`/`sanitizeName`/`mkdir`/write) — Jini's kernel has no
`Project` concept at all (locked architecture §2.1). `createMediaDispatchEngine().generate()`
returns `{ bytes, providerNote, ... }` to the caller instead; a host pairs
this with its own `AttachmentStaging`/`MediaTaskStore` wiring. Reference-image
resolution follows the same pattern `video-request.ts`'s `VideoBuildInput.imageRef`
already established: the caller resolves any reference image to a data URL
before calling — this package performs no filesystem I/O anywhere, not just
in the new code. Credential resolution is dependency-injected
(`MediaDispatchEngineOptions.credentials`) rather than reading an
OD-project-scoped config file (`resolveProviderConfig`, already excluded
below); `resolveProviderCredentialsFromEnv` is an opt-in reference resolver
using `providers.ts`'s already-ported `PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_ENV_VARS`, not
something the engine calls itself. OD's per-project model-alias layer
(`resolveModelAlias`) is also not ported (see below); the request type
carries an optional `wireModel` a host can set instead.

| Jini file | Origin (`media/index.ts`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/dispatch/types.ts` | `MediaContext`/`RenderResult`/`ProviderConfig` shapes | Redefined per the boundary redesign above — see its own module doc comment. |
| `src/dispatch/engine.ts` | `generateMedia`'s orchestration (validation, `clampNumber`/`clampWithWarning`, dispatch if/else-if chain) | Ported behaviorally: surface/audioKind/model/catalogue validation, numeric clamping with warnings, the `customImageOverridesOpenAIModel` precedence rule. The `codexSubscriptionModel`/`useCodexSubscription` branch is dropped entirely (codex is already excluded from `providers.ts`). The fal-`ai/*`-path and `aihubmix-`-prefix catalogue-bypass branches (`isFalCustomPath`/`isCatalogBypass`) are **not yet ported** — they exist in the origin specifically to support the fal/AIHubMix renderers, which aren't wired up yet either; porting the bypass without the renderer would be dead code. Context construction was pulled out into `context.ts`'s `buildRenderContext` (see its own row below) specifically so `ctx.promptInfluence`/`ctx.imageRefs` — real origin fields not consumed by any renderer ported in this pass — could be kept in the type surface and directly, honestly tested, rather than dropped as "unobservable" or left untested. One genuinely dead branch was removed rather than tested around, matching this repo's coverage-driven-refactor convention: a `findProvider(def.provider)` null-check in the stub-fallback path (every catalogued model's `provider` id is proven present in `MEDIA_PROVIDERS` by a new `providers.test.ts` catalogue-integrity test, added this pass). |
| `src/dispatch/context.ts` | `generateMedia`'s `ctx` object-literal construction | *(new file, extracted from `engine.ts`)* `buildRenderContext(request, resolvedAudioKind, length, duration)` — pure, exported, and directly unit-tested (`context.test.ts`) independent of any renderer. This is the mechanism that lets `promptInfluence`/`imageRefs` stay real, tested fields despite having no current consumer: rather than needing a live renderer to observe their computed value (impossible for a not-yet-ported vendor) or dropping them from the type surface (a real capability regression relative to the origin), their derivation is tested directly against this function's return value. `clampNumber`'s `allowed.length === 0` guard was removed as separately-proven-dead (see the `engine.ts` row) — that one **is** a true no-behavior-change simplification, not a scope question, since it's an internal defensive guard with no user-visible capability, unlike `promptInfluence`/`imageRefs` which are real request fields. |
| `src/dispatch/openai-compatible.ts` | The shared OpenAI-wire-compatible helpers (`parseOpenAICompatibleJson`, `bytesFromOpenAICompatibleData`, `detectAzureEndpoint`, `normalizeOpenAICompatiblePath`, `buildOpenAICompatibleGenerationUrl`, `buildOpenAIImageUrl`, `buildOpenAIImageEditUrl`, `buildOpenAIVideoUrl`, `openaiSizeFor`, `buildOpenAISpeechUrl`, `sniffImageExt`, `truncate`) | Ported verbatim. Shared by OpenAI, ImageRouter, and custom-image today; AIHubMix's image/TTS renderers (not yet ported) also route through this same OpenAI-compatible shape in the origin, so porting them later should mostly be new provider-specific glue on top of this already-ported layer, not new shared plumbing. `openaiSpeechFormatFor(fileName)` was redesigned as `resolveSpeechFormat(requested)` — the origin derived the TTS response format from the caller's output filename extension; since this engine has no filename/output-path concept, the caller now passes an explicit `speechFormat` request field instead (defaults to `'mp3'`, matching the origin's default). |
| `src/dispatch/stub.ts` | `renderStub`/`svgPlaceholder`/`aspectToBox`/`silentWav` | Ported behaviorally. The origin picked SVG-vs-PNG placeholder bytes from the caller's requested output filename extension; since there's no filename here, the image stub always returns the PNG placeholder (`svgPlaceholder` is still exported standalone for a caller that wants it directly). `OD_MEDIA_ALLOW_STUBS` (an env var the origin reads itself) becomes `MediaDispatchEngineOptions.allowStubFallback` (an explicit constructor option) — this package never reads `process.env` (see `providers.ts`'s standing invariant), so the origin's fail-closed-unless-opted-in design is preserved via an option, not an env var. |
| `src/dispatch/credentials.ts` | *(new)* | `resolveProviderCredentialsFromEnv` — opt-in reference resolver, not called by the engine itself; see boundary redesign above. |
| `src/dispatch/providers/openai.ts` | `renderOpenAIImage`, `renderOpenAISpeech` | Ported verbatim, including Azure OpenAI deployment detection/handling and the long-timeout `undici.Agent` default for image generation (added `undici` as a package dependency, mirroring `packages/deploy`). The Codex-CLI-subscription fallback path (`codexSubscriptionModel`/`renderCodexImage`) is dropped — see "Not ported" below. |
| `src/dispatch/providers/imagerouter.ts` | `renderImageRouterImage`, `renderImageRouterVideo`, `imageRouterSizeFor` | Ported verbatim. Uses `providers.ts`'s already-catalogued `imagerouter` default base URL as its fallback rather than a second hardcoded constant (the origin had a local `IMAGEROUTER_DEFAULT_BASE_URL` duplicating the same value already in `models.ts`'s catalogue — de-duplicated here, not a behavior change). |
| `src/dispatch/providers/custom-image.ts` | `renderCustomOpenAIImage`, `customImageOverridesOpenAIModel` | Ported verbatim. |

### Not yet ported (real, itemized gap — not silently dropped)

Every other `render*` function in the origin, grouped by why it's deferred:

- **Async-polling vendors** (submit-then-poll-then-fetch, materially more
  complex than the synchronous ones ported this pass): Volcengine video
  (`renderVolcengineVideo`), Grok video (`renderGrokVideo`), OpenRouter video
  (`renderOpenRouterVideo`), AIHubMix video (`renderAIHubMixVideo`), Fal
  image/video (`renderFalImage`/`renderFalVideo`, queue-based), and
  **Leonardo image (`renderLeonardoImage`)** — see the 2026-07-21 addition
  below for why Leonardo moved into this bucket despite being originally
  (mis)categorized as "simple synchronous." Note: `src/video-request.ts`
  (already ported, see above) implements the seedance/wan/veo/generic family
  request-body-building logic as a separate, reusable layer — but the
  origin's actual live `media/index.ts` dispatcher does **not** call into it
  (no such import exists in `media/index.ts`); whoever ports these should
  decide whether to reuse `buildVideoRequest` or mirror the origin's
  separate implementation, not assume they're already wired together.
- **Simple synchronous REST vendors**: none left in this bucket — the
  remaining candidates (Volcengine image, Grok/xAI TTS, ElevenLabs TTS +
  SFX, MiniMax TTS, SenseAudio TTS + image, AIHubMix image + Gemini image +
  TTS, FishAudio TTS) were all ported in the 2026-07-21 (round 2) pass —
  see that section below. MiniMax image (`renderMinimaxImage`) and AIHubMix
  video (`renderAIHubMixVideo`) are the only `render*` functions left on
  those two vendors' provider slots — the former reads `process.env`
  directly for its base URL (out of scope, see the round-2 section), the
  latter is async-polling (see the bucket above).
- **Local-process vendors, need their own design decision, not just a
  translation**: HyperFrames (`renderHyperFramesViaCli`) shells out to a
  local `npx hyperframes render` + Puppeteer/Chrome and is tied to a
  project-directory concept the way the whole engine used to be — deferred
  alongside the general project-directory redesign, not a REST port at all.
- **`resolveProjectImage`** — the origin's own reference-image path
  resolver (containment check under an OD project dir, 16 MB size cap, mime
  allowlist, base64 data-URL encoding) is not ported as a callable utility
  in this package; per the boundary redesign, callers resolve reference
  images to data URLs themselves. A future pass could still port
  `resolveProjectImage`'s security logic (containment/size-cap/mime-allowlist)
  as a standalone, caller-owned-root utility so hosts don't have to
  re-invent it — flagged as a worthwhile small follow-up, not done this
  pass since the engine itself doesn't need it to function.
- **The fal-`ai/*`-path and `aihubmix-`-prefix catalogue bypass** in
  `generateMedia`'s model-resolution step — see the `engine.ts` row above.

## 2026-07-21 addition — three more vendor slices (Grok image, Nano Banana, OpenRouter image; backlog pass, `feat/http-routes-and-cli-commands`)

Ported the next batch of the dispatch engine's "simple synchronous REST
vendors, not yet ported" bullet (previous section). Verified against
`nexu-io/open-design` fork `leonaburime-ucla/open-design`, branch
`refactor/web-memory-slice`, commit `d695f1e0f` (2026-07-14), the same
origin `media/index.ts` the initial dispatch-engine pass cited — via `git
show lucla/refactor-web-memory-slice:apps/daemon/src/media/index.ts` from a
local `Open-Marketing` clone with that ref fetched. All three render
functions plus their helper functions were read in full (not grepped) at
their real line ranges in that 4,256-line file.

| Jini file | Origin (`media/index.ts`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/dispatch/providers/grok.ts` | `renderGrokImage` (L1756–1812) + `grokAspectFor` (L2567–2581) | Ported behaviorally. The response shape (`{ data: [{ b64_json \| url }] }`) is identical to OpenAI's images API, so — per the task brief's explicit instruction to check for this before writing new shared plumbing — this routes through `openai-compatible.ts`'s already-ported `buildOpenAIImageUrl`/`parseOpenAICompatibleJson`/`bytesFromOpenAICompatibleData`/`sniffImageExt` rather than re-implementing URL-building/JSON-parsing/byte-extraction inline the way the origin does (verified the substitution is behavior-preserving: for a base URL like `https://api.x.ai/v1`, `buildOpenAIImageUrl(baseUrl, false)` reduces to the same `https://api.x.ai/v1/images/generations` the origin's naive `` `${baseUrl}/images/generations` `` concat produces — it's a strict improvement, additionally handling trailing slashes/query strings the manual concat wouldn't). Dropped the origin's no-credential error message's OD-specific OAuth guidance ("sign in with your SuperGrok subscription (in OD or via `hermes auth add xai-oauth`)") — this package has no OAuth chain or local-CLI-login concept; credentials are always host-injected, matching every other ported provider's plain "configure an API key or set `<ENV_VAR>`" message style. `grokAspectFor` was rewritten from the origin's one `\|\|`-chained `if` condition into a sequence of independent `if` returns, matching this package's established aspect/size-mapping style (`imagerouter.ts`'s `imageRouterSizeFor`, `openai-compatible.ts`'s `openaiSizeFor`) — same input→output mapping for all 6 cases (5 recognized aspects + default), verified by testing each one individually; not a behavior change, and incidentally the more directly-100%-branch-coverage-friendly shape for a chain of `\|\|`-guarded string-equality checks. |
| `src/dispatch/providers/nanobanana.ts` | `renderNanoBananaImage` (L1814–1859) + `nanoBananaHeaders`/`usesOfficialGoogleApiKeyHeader`/`nanoBananaAspectFor`/`inlineImageBytesFromGenerateContent` (L1861–1927) | Ported behaviorally, including the official-Google-endpoint-vs-custom-gateway header-selection logic (`x-goog-api-key` for `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`, `Authorization: Bearer` for anything else, including a malformed/unparseable `baseUrl` — the origin's own defensive `try/catch` around `new URL(baseUrl)` is preserved and directly tested, not assumed unreachable). **Not** routed through `openai-compatible.ts`'s OpenAI-images helpers — Gemini's `generateContent` request shape (`contents[].parts[].text` + `generationConfig`) and response shape (`candidates[].content.parts[].inlineData.data`) share nothing with `/images/generations`'s `{ data: [...] }` shape, so reusing those helpers would have been a shape mismatch, not a legitimate de-duplication (per the task brief's own "wherever a vendor's real implementation routes through the same OpenAI-wire-compatible shape" qualifier). Only the genuinely vendor-agnostic utilities (`truncate`, `sniffImageExt`, `withRequestInit`) are reused; the JSON-parse-with-tagged-error and nested-candidate-walk logic are new, matching the origin's own inline (non-shared) implementation. `nanoBananaAspectFor` got the same independent-`if`-returns rewrite as `grokAspectFor` above, for the same reason (no behavior change, matches this package's established style). |
| `src/dispatch/providers/openrouter.ts` | `renderOpenRouterImage` (L1947–2055) + `openRouterAspectFor` (L2287–2301) | Ported behaviorally: model-slug resolution (`credentials.model` over `ctx.wireModel`, then strip the catalogue's `openrouter/` prefix), the `gemini`-slug-in-model-name heuristic for `modalities: ['image','text']` vs `['image']`, and all three response-decoding paths (`data:` URI, plain `http(s)` URL download, bare-base64 fallback). **Not** routed through `openai-compatible.ts`'s OpenAI-images helpers — this vendor's image surface goes through `/chat/completions` (messages + `modalities`), not `/images/generations`, and its response embeds images at `choices[0].message.images[].image_url.url`, not `data[].{b64_json,url}` — a genuinely different wire shape from the same vendor's own *video* surface (which the source-map's async-polling bucket defers). Only `truncate`/`sniffImageExt`/`withRequestInit` are reused. **Dropped** the origin's `HTTP-Referer: https://opendesign.dev` / `X-Title: Open Design` request headers — OpenRouter's optional app-attribution headers (used for their model leaderboard, not required for the request to succeed), and both literal values are Open-Design product identity, out of scope per AGENTS.md's product-identity-string boundary; this package has no host-identity concept to substitute a neutral value with, and `MediaGenerationRequestInit` (`Pick<RequestInit, 'dispatcher'>`) doesn't expose a way for a caller to inject extra headers either, so this is a real (harmless, non-required) capability drop, flagged rather than silently absorbed into "de-branding." `openRouterAspectFor` got the same independent-`if`-returns rewrite as `grokAspectFor` above. |

**`engine.ts` / `ROUTES`**: added `grok: { image: renderGrokImage }`,
`nanobanana: { image: renderNanoBananaImage }`, `openrouter: { image:
renderOpenRouterImage }`. `engine.test.ts`'s two stub-fallback tests
previously used `grok-imagine-image` as their "known-unwired pair" fixture
— now that grok+image is wired, they were switched to `leonardo-phoenix`
(leonardo+image), which stays genuinely unwired (see below). Three new
engine-level dispatch-routing tests were added (mirroring the existing
openai/imagerouter/custom-image routing tests) to prove the `ROUTES` table
entries resolve correctly end-to-end, not just that each provider file's
own render function works in isolation.

**Leonardo re-categorized, not ported.** The task brief's candidate list
(inherited from this source-map's own prior "simple synchronous REST
vendors" categorization) named `renderLeonardoImage` alongside Grok/Nano
Banana/OpenRouter. Reading its real body this pass (L2303–2429) found that
categorization was wrong: Leonardo's image generation is
submit-then-poll-then-fetch — `POST /generations` returns a
`generationId`, then a `while (Date.now() - startedAt < 120_000)` loop polls
`GET /generations/{id}` every 2 seconds until `status === 'COMPLETE'` (or
throws on `'FAILED'`/timeout) before downloading the final image URL. That
is structurally the same async-polling shape as the video vendors the task
brief explicitly said not to attempt this pass (submit → poll → fetch,
needing its own timer/retry/timeout design and fake-timer-driven tests, not
a same-shape translation of the three ported above) — not a "simple
synchronous" vendor at all. Rather than force a port that doesn't fit this
pass's scope just because it was on the suggested list, Leonardo was moved
into the "Async-polling vendors" bucket in the "Not yet ported" section
above, and `engine.test.ts`'s stub-fallback fixture was repointed at it
specifically because it's a real, still-unwired (provider, surface) pair.

Tests: `src/dispatch/providers/__tests__/grok.test.ts` (7 tests),
`src/dispatch/providers/__tests__/nanobanana.test.ts` (11 tests),
`src/dispatch/providers/__tests__/openrouter.test.ts` (15 tests), plus 3 new
`engine.test.ts` routing tests and 2 repointed stub-fallback tests. Mocks a
real `fetch`/`Response` throughout (matching the existing dispatch-engine
tests' convention), not the provider functions themselves — every
URL-building/header-selection/body-shaping/response-decoding branch is
exercised end-to-end, including: the Google-official-vs-custom-gateway
header branch (and its malformed-`baseUrl` fallback), every aspect-mapping
case for all three vendors, the `gemini`-slug modality heuristic, the
`openrouter/`-prefix-strip both-ways branch, and all three of OpenRouter's
image-decoding paths (data URI / http(s) download / bare base64) plus its
download-failure path. No new dependency.

**Coverage**: 100% statements / 100% branches / 100% functions / 100% lines,
package-wide (`pnpm --dir packages/media exec vitest run --coverage`) —
316 tests across 20 files, up from 280/17. `tsc --noEmit` and `pnpm guard`
both clean.

## 2026-07-21 addition (round 2) — the rest of the "simple synchronous REST vendors" bucket (`feat/http-routes-and-cli-commands`)

Ported every vendor left in the previous section's "Simple synchronous
REST vendors, not yet ported" bullet: Volcengine image, xAI/Grok TTS,
ElevenLabs TTS + SFX, MiniMax TTS, SenseAudio TTS + image, AIHubMix image +
Gemini-native image + TTS, and FishAudio TTS. Verified against the same
origin ref as round 1 — `nexu-io/open-design` fork
`leonaburime-ucla/open-design`, branch `refactor/web-memory-slice`, commit
`d695f1e0f` — via `git show
lucla/refactor-web-memory-slice:apps/daemon/src/media/index.ts` from a
local `Open-Marketing` clone with that ref already fetched. Every render
function plus its helpers was read in full (not grepped) at its real line
range in that file; two cross-file dependencies (SenseAudio's/AIHubMix's
`url`-fetch SSRF guard, AIHubMix's shared vendor-identity plumbing) were
each traced to their own origin file and read in full too — see their own
rows below.

**New shared substrate ported ahead of the vendors that need it:**

| Jini file | Origin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/dispatch/ssrf-guard.ts` | `apps/daemon/src/connectionTest.ts` `assertAndFetchExternalAsset` (L238–245) / `assertExternalAssetUrl` (L208–224) / `validateBaseUrlResolved` (L130–167), plus the sync hostname classifiers `isLoopbackApiHost`/`isBlockedExternalApiHostname`/`validateBaseUrl` from `packages/contracts/src/api/connectionTest.ts` (L93–175) | SenseAudio's and AIHubMix's image renderers both fetch a gateway-returned `url` that is attacker-controllable inside an otherwise-successful response — the origin routes both through this guard (DNS-resolve the host, reject loopback/RFC1918/link-local/CGNAT/multicast/metadata-service addresses, pin `redirect: 'error'` so a validated public URL can't 302 into private space). Ported behaviorally intact, including every IPv4/IPv6 blocklist boundary (CGNAT `100.64.0.0/10`, RFC1918, IPv6 `fc00::/7`/`fe80::/10`, IPv4-mapped-IPv6 literals in both dotted-quad and hex-group form). **Scope cut, proven not assumed**: the origin's `allowedInternalHosts` operator-allowlist option (`ValidateBaseUrlOptions`/`isAllowlistedInternalHost`, consulted only by a *different* exported function, `validateUserProviderBaseUrl`, for user-*configured* provider endpoints) is not ported — `assertExternalAssetUrl` calls `validateBaseUrlResolved(rawUrl)` with no options, so `allowedInternalHosts` is always `undefined` on this call path, and `isAllowlistedInternalHost` returns `false` unconditionally whenever that argument is empty (its own first line), making the allowlist branch provably dead code on the only path this module ports — not assumed unreachable, traced. `validateBaseUrlResolved`/`assertExternalAssetUrl`/`assertAndFetchExternalAsset` each gained an optional trailing `lookup: DnsLookupFn` parameter (absent from the origin's signatures) purely for deterministic testing (mirroring `vi.spyOn(fs.promises, ...)`'s role in this package's existing `staging.test.ts`) — default behavior via `node:dns`'s real resolver is unchanged and also directly tested. |
| `src/dispatch/providers/aihubmix-shared.ts` | `apps/daemon/src/integrations/aihubmix.ts`: `AIHUBMIX_APP_CODE`/`AIHUBMIX_DEFAULT_BASE_URL` (L22–27), `aihubmixHeaders`/`aihubmixAppCodeHeader` (L34–52), `classifyAIHubMixModel` (L62–75), `aihubmixOriginFromBase` (L84–90), `aihubmixGeminiImageUrl` (L93–98), `aihubmixGeminiImageBytes` (L122–158), `aihubmixWireModel` (L165–173) | The AIHubMix vendor-identity plumbing `providers/aihubmix.ts` needs. **One proven dead-code simplification**: `aihubmixAppCodeHeader()` dropped the origin's `AIHUBMIX_APP_CODE ? {...} : {}` ternary — `AIHUBMIX_APP_CODE` is a fixed non-empty literal (`'DMCY9912'`) with no configuration surface in either the origin or this port, so the `: {}` branch is unreachable through any real call; simplified to an unconditional header rather than left as an untested branch or covered with a contrived test that fakes an empty app code. Everything else (model-name protocol classification including the `-nothink`/`-search`/embedding exclusions, the Gemini-native `generateContent` request/response shape, the `aihubmix-` catalog-id-to-wire-name mapping) ported behaviorally intact. **Not ported** (not needed by the image/TTS render path): `aihubmixVideoSeconds` (video is deferred, see the async-polling bucket above), `aihubmixCatalogUrl`/`parseAIHubMixCatalog`/`AIHubMixCatalogModel` (a model-catalogue-discovery HTTP call, not part of generation), `AIHUBMIX_IMAGE_ASPECT_TO_SIZE` (used by OD's in-chat `generate_image` tool; the media renderer uses `openai-compatible.ts`'s already-ported `openaiSizeFor` instead). |

**Vendor slices:**

| Jini file | Origin (`media/index.ts`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/dispatch/providers/volcengine.ts` | `renderVolcengineImage` (L1686–1736) | Routes through `openai-compatible.ts`'s shared OpenAI-images helpers — same wire shape as `openai`/`grok`/`imagerouter`. Two origin quirks preserved rather than silently "fixed": `suggestedExt` is hardcoded to `.png` (never sniffed, unlike `grok.ts`) since Seedream/Seededit are documented to always return PNG; and `openaiSizeFor(ctx.model, ctx.aspect)` always returns `1024x1024` for every Volcengine catalog id (it only special-cases `gpt-image-*`/`dall-e-3`) — a known origin review note (`lefarcen + codex P2 on PR #1309` in the origin's own inline comment), not a bug this port introduced. Also flagged: unlike `senseaudio.ts`/`aihubmix.ts` (ported this same pass), the origin's `entry.url` fallback here is a plain `fetch`, not SSRF-guarded — matching the real origin exactly (`assertAndFetchExternalAsset` is only called from the SenseAudio-image/AIHubMix-image/AIHubMix-video renderers in the actual source), the same asymmetry `openai.ts`'s/`grok.ts`'s own `entry.url` fallbacks already have. |
| `src/dispatch/providers/grok.ts` (added to, not new) | `renderXAITTS` (L2597–2646) | xAI's `/tts` endpoint takes a plain `{text, voice_id, language}` body and always returns raw mp3 bytes directly — no per-request format field — so this doesn't route through `openai-compatible.ts`'s speech-format helpers (unlike `openai.ts`'s TTS), only the generic `truncate`/`withRequestInit`. Same file as the already-ported `renderGrokImage` (same vendor/provider id), matching `openai.ts`'s precedent of one file per vendor covering multiple surfaces. `engine.ts`'s `grok` route table gained `'audio:speech': renderXAITTS`. |
| `src/dispatch/providers/elevenlabs.ts` | `renderElevenLabsTTS` (L2699–2750), `renderElevenLabsSfx` (L2752–2801) | Neither endpoint is OpenAI-wire-compatible (ElevenLabs-specific JSON-body-in, raw-bytes-out), so only the generic `truncate`/`withRequestInit` are reused. SFX's duration/`prompt_influence` clamping and 450-char prompt-length cap ported behaviorally intact. Two prompt-validation error messages reworded (not weakened): the origin's "Pass --prompt before retrying"/"Shorten --prompt before retrying" assume an OD `hermes`-CLI `--prompt` flag this package's plain `MediaGenerationRequest.prompt` field has no equivalent of for every possible host — reworded to describe the constraint without the CLI-flag assumption; the underlying validation (non-empty; ≤450 chars) is unchanged. |
| `src/dispatch/providers/minimax.ts` | `renderMinimaxTTS` (L2842–2931) | Not OpenAI-wire-compatible (MiniMax's own `voice_setting`/`audio_setting` body + a `base_resp` envelope where an HTTP 200 can still be a logical failure), so only `truncate`/`withRequestInit` are reused. Ported the wire-model precedence chain intact (an explicit caller alias via `ctx.wireModel !== ctx.model` wins over the legacy rename map, which wins over the catalog id passthrough) and the `extra_info.audio_length` centisecond-to-seconds `providerNote` formatting. `renderMinimaxImage` (L2950–3039, a *different* surface on the same provider slot) is **not ported** — out of scope for this task (only MiniMax TTS was asked for) and it reads `process.env.OD_MINIMAX_IMAGE_BASE_URL` directly, which this package's standing no-`process.env`-access invariant would require redesigning around before porting. |
| `src/dispatch/providers/senseaudio.ts` | `renderSenseAudioTTS` (L3088–3163), `senseAudioImageSize` (L3190–3196), `renderSenseAudioImage` (L3198–3283) | TTS mirrors MiniMax's own body/`base_resp` shape (same reasoning, only generic helpers reused). Image returns `{ url }` (not `{ data: [...] }`) and that `url` is downloaded through `ssrf-guard.ts`'s `assertAndFetchExternalAsset`, matching the origin exactly. Ported the image API's dual failure-signaling paths intact — a `base_resp` envelope AND a separate top-level `error_message` field, checked independently, exactly as the origin does — plus the 2000-char prompt truncation and the aspect-to-size table. |
| `src/dispatch/providers/aihubmix.ts` | `renderAIHubMixImage` (L3295–3358), `renderAIHubMixGeminiImage` (L3364–3389), `renderAIHubMixTTS` (L3391–3421) | The default (non-Gemini) image path and TTS route through `openai-compatible.ts`'s shared helpers (AIHubMix's default wire shape is genuinely OpenAI-compatible — the whole point of the aggregator); `renderAIHubMixTTS` reuses `openai.ts`'s already-shared `OPENAI_TTS_VOICES`/`resolveSpeechFormat`. Gemini/imagen-family catalog ids are internally redirected to the Gemini-native path (a real per-model wire-shape branch in the origin, not a simplification this port added) via `aihubmix-shared.ts`'s `aihubmixGeminiImageBytes`. The image path's `entry.url` fallback is SSRF-guarded, matching the origin and `senseaudio.ts`'s identical reasoning. **One proven dead-code elimination**: the origin's `renderAIHubMixGeminiImage` is a top-level function taking the full `credentials: ProviderConfig` and re-checking `credentials.apiKey` — but it has exactly one call site (`renderAIHubMixImage`, immediately after that same check already threw on a missing key), so the second check can never fire; grepped the whole origin file to confirm no other call site exists. This port keeps the Gemini path as a private (non-exported) helper — the origin never called it from anywhere else either — and passes the already-validated `apiKey: string` directly instead of the whole optional-`apiKey` credentials object, eliminating the dead branch via the type system rather than leaving an untested `if` or a test that fakes a call path the real dispatcher never takes. |
| `src/dispatch/providers/fishaudio.ts` | `renderFishAudioTTS` (L3607–3661) | Raw audio bytes directly (not JSON-wrapped), so only the generic helpers are reused. Same wire-model precedence chain as `minimax.ts` — the origin's own inline comment on this function says so explicitly ("Same precedence as the MINIMAX TTS path"). |

**`engine.ts` / `ROUTES`**: added `volcengine: { image: renderVolcengineImage }`,
`elevenlabs: { 'audio:speech': renderElevenLabsTTS, 'audio:sfx':
renderElevenLabsSfx }`, `minimax: { 'audio:speech': renderMinimaxTTS }`,
`senseaudio: { image: renderSenseAudioImage, 'audio:speech':
renderSenseAudioTTS }`, `fishaudio: { 'audio:speech': renderFishAudioTTS }`,
`aihubmix: { image: renderAIHubMixImage, 'audio:speech': renderAIHubMixTTS
}`, and added `'audio:speech': renderXAITTS` to the existing `grok` entry.
One new engine-level dispatch-routing test per newly-wired (provider,
surface) pair, mirroring the existing routing tests — proving the
`ROUTES` table entries resolve end-to-end, not just that each provider
file's own render function works in isolation.

Tests: `ssrf-guard.test.ts` (38 tests, including every IPv4/IPv6 blocklist
boundary value), `aihubmix-shared.test.ts` (22 tests), `volcengine.test.ts`
(5), `grok.test.ts` grew by 6 (renderXAITTS), `elevenlabs.test.ts` (19),
`minimax.test.ts` (15), `senseaudio.test.ts` (33), `aihubmix.test.ts` (26),
`fishaudio.test.ts` (8), plus 6 new `engine.test.ts` routing tests. Mocks a
real `fetch`/`Response` throughout, matching the existing dispatch-engine
tests' convention — including the SSRF-guarded download paths, which use
real (non-mocked) public/private IP *literals* (e.g. `203.0.113.5` /
`10.0.0.5`) as the returned asset URL so `ssrf-guard.ts`'s literal-IP
short-circuit is exercised without needing to fake DNS resolution; the
DNS-resolve branch itself is separately covered in `ssrf-guard.test.ts`
directly (via an injected `lookup` function and, for the real
`node:dns`-backed default, `vi.spyOn(dnsPromises, 'lookup')` — the same
`vi.spyOn`-on-a-Node-built-in pattern this package's `staging.test.ts`
already established).

**Coverage**: 100% statements / 100% branches / 100% functions / 100% lines,
package-wide (`pnpm --dir packages/media exec vitest run --coverage`) —
496 tests across 28 files, up from 316/20. `tsc --noEmit` and `pnpm guard`
both clean.

## 2026-07-21 addition (round 3) — generalize the dispatch engine into a real multi-provider mechanism + durable task-store adapter (`feat/http-routes-and-cli-commands`)

The prior two 2026-07-21 passes ported vendor after vendor, but each was
still its own hand-written `render*` async function — a growing pile of
similar-shaped but independently-implemented fetch/error-handling/byte-
extraction logic, not a system where registering a new vendor is
*configuration*. This pass closes that gap for a first slice of vendors,
plus adds the durable task-store adapter `task-store.ts`'s row above always
called out as a deferred future task.

**New generic mechanism:**

| Jini file | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/dispatch/vendor-adapter.ts` | `VendorAdapter<Meta>` — `{ requireCredential?, buildRequest, parseResponse }` — plus `dispatchVendorRequest(adapter, ctx, credentials)`, the generic harness: `requireCredential` -> `buildRequest` -> one `fetch` -> `parseResponse`. `parseResponse` stays a full function (not a further declarative shape) because some vendors need a *second* network call mid-parse (SenseAudio's SSRF-guarded asset download) — see the module's own doc comment for why a purely declarative parser DSL was rejected. Also exports `requireApiKey(message)`, a reference `VendorCredentialGuard` covering the identical `if (!credentials.apiKey) throw ...` check every vendor previously hand-wrote. |
| `src/dispatch/vendor-registry.ts` | `VendorAdapterRegistry` — a `(providerId, routeKey) -> VendorAdapter` map a vendor module registers into at import time, keyed by the same `routeKey` shape `engine.ts`'s `routeKeyFor` already produces (`'image'`, `'audio:speech'`, ...). `register()` throws on a duplicate `(providerId, routeKey)` pair (a vendor module should register each pair exactly once). Exports both `createVendorAdapterRegistry()` (an isolated instance, used by tests) and the shared `mediaVendorRegistry` singleton every migrated vendor module registers into and `engine.ts` consults. |
| `src/dispatch/response-parsers.ts` | Two `VendorResponseParser` factories for response shapes verified (by reading real vendor bodies, not assumed) to repeat byte-for-byte across multiple vendors: `createRawBytesParser` (POST JSON, raw bytes back with no envelope — `fishaudio.ts`, `openai.ts`'s speech renderer) and `createHexEnvelopeAudioParser` (POST JSON, hex-encoded audio inside a `base_resp`-enveloped JSON body where an HTTP 200 can still be a logical failure — `minimax.ts`, `senseaudio.ts`'s TTS renderer, verified identical down to the literal error-message templates). Vendors whose shape doesn't genuinely match either factory (OpenAI's own image response, whose non-JSON error is deliberately NOT azure-tag-aware while its non-OK error IS; SenseAudio's image response, which needs a second SSRF-guarded fetch) correctly keep bespoke `parseResponse` functions instead of being forced through a shared shape that would silently change their behavior. |

**`engine.ts`**: `resolveRenderer(providerId, routeKey)` now checks
`mediaVendorRegistry` first, falling back to the static `ROUTES` table for
vendors not yet migrated. The `openai`/`minimax`/`senseaudio`/`fishaudio`
`ROUTES` entries were *removed* (not left as a redundant duplicate path) and
those four providers' modules are now imported for their registration side
effect only (`import './providers/openai.js'` etc.) — proving resolution
for those four goes through the registry exclusively, not parallel unused
scaffolding sitting beside the old table.

**Vendors actually migrated onto the generic engine this pass (4):**
`providers/openai.ts` (both `renderOpenAIImage` — custom `parseResponse`,
kept bespoke deliberately, see its own doc comment — and
`renderOpenAISpeech` — via `createRawBytesParser`), `providers/minimax.ts`
(`renderMinimaxTTS`, via `createHexEnvelopeAudioParser`),
`providers/senseaudio.ts` (`renderSenseAudioTTS` via
`createHexEnvelopeAudioParser`; `renderSenseAudioImage` keeps a custom
`parseResponse` for its SSRF-guarded second fetch + dual `base_resp`/
`error_message` failure paths), `providers/fishaudio.ts`
(`renderFishAudioTTS`, via `createRawBytesParser`). Each vendor's public
`render*` export is now a one-line `dispatchVendorRequest(adapter, ctx,
credentials)` call; the adapter itself is registered into
`mediaVendorRegistry` at module load.

**Not migrated this pass** (still hand-written functions dispatched via the
static `ROUTES` table): `aihubmix.ts`, `custom-image.ts`, `elevenlabs.ts`,
`grok.ts`, `imagerouter.ts`, `nanobanana.ts`, `openrouter.ts`,
`volcengine.ts`. A real, itemized remaining gap, not silently dropped — a
future pass can migrate these the same way; nothing about the mechanism is
vendor-count-limited.

**Proof external behavior didn't regress**: `openai.test.ts`,
`minimax.test.ts`, `senseaudio.test.ts`, `fishaudio.test.ts`, and
`engine.test.ts` — all pre-existing, all asserting real URL/body/header/
error-message/`providerNote` shape against a mocked `fetch` — were **not
edited** during this pass (confirmed via `git log` on each file: no commit
in this pass touches them) and still pass unmodified against the refactored
adapters. `engine.test.ts` in particular still exercises the four migrated
(provider, surface) pairs end-to-end through `createMediaDispatchEngine()`
without knowing the registry exists — proving the registry-first resolution
is a transparent internal reshuffle from a caller's perspective, not a
public-behavior change.

**Durable task-store adapter (`src/sqlite-task-store.ts`, new):**
`createSqliteMediaTaskStore(dbPath)` — a `better-sqlite3`-backed
`MediaTaskStore` implementation, added per this pass's explicit "durable
task adapter" brief: several already-ported/future vendors are async
submit-then-poll jobs, so a job's state must survive a process restart, not
just live in the in-memory reference (`createInMemoryMediaTaskStore` in
`task-store.ts`). Reuses this repo's existing durability pattern exactly —
`packages/sqlite/src/event-log.ts`'s `createSqliteEventLog` (the durable
adapter for `@jini/daemon`'s `EventLog` port) — rather than inventing a
parallel one: `new Database(dbPath)`, `db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL')`,
idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` (so reopening the same file resumes
from whatever was durably committed), `db.transaction()` for atomic
multi-statement writes, every public method still `Promise`-returning
despite `better-sqlite3` being synchronous under the hood, and a `close():
Promise<void>` addition beyond the port interface. Implements the exact same
`queued -> running -> done|failed|interrupted` transition legality
(`ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`), duplicate-id rejection, `listByOwner` terminal-
status filtering, and two-phase `reconcileOnBoot` boot reconciliation as
`createInMemoryMediaTaskStore` — proven, not asserted, by
`sqlite-task-store.test.ts` running the same conformance shape as
`task-store.test.ts` against the sqlite adapter instead, plus a
durability-across-restart section with no in-memory equivalent: creates a
task, `close()`s the store (simulating the process dying), opens a **fresh**
`createSqliteMediaTaskStore(dbPath)` instance against the same file, and
confirms an in-flight (`running`) job's state — including its `progress`
array — is readable from that new instance and that `reconcileOnBoot` on
the fresh instance correctly marks it `interrupted` with `DAEMON_RESTART`.
This is a genuine "does state survive a restart" test, not just "state is
written somewhere."

**Why `@jini/media`, not `@jini/sqlite`** (the `EventLog` precedent's
"natural" home, where the durable adapter lives in a package separate from
the port it implements): `@jini/sqlite` is one of
`scripts/check-engine-boundaries.ts`'s 14 *locked* packages (per
`UNLOCKED.md`); `@jini/media` is listed there with `status: "incubating"`.
The boundary rule forbids a locked package from importing an unlocked,
non-`"stable"` one — `@jini/sqlite` depending on `@jini/media` for
`MediaTaskStore`'s types would fail `pnpm guard` outright. Implementing the
adapter inside `@jini/media` (itself unlocked, so unrestricted in what it
may depend on) keeps the identical schema/transaction/WAL/`close()`
conventions without a guard violation. The open question of whether this
should move to `@jini/sqlite` once `@jini/media` is promoted to `"stable"`
is tracked in
`ADS-memory/reports/proposals/PROP-media-durable-tasks-2026-07-21.md`.

**New dependency**: `better-sqlite3 ^11.10.0` (dependency) + `@types/
better-sqlite3 ^7.6.11` (devDependency) — the first `better-sqlite3` use in
this package (`task-store.ts`'s in-memory reference adapter has none).

**Tests**: `response-parsers.test.ts` (14), `vendor-adapter.test.ts` (9),
`vendor-registry.test.ts` (11 — including one asserting every vendor
migrated onto the generic engine is actually registered once its module is
imported, not just registrable in principle), `sqlite-task-store.test.ts`
(33, including the four-test durability-across-restart `describe` block
above). Package-wide: **563 tests across 32 files, up from 496/28** (a net
+67 tests / +4 files — the four new test files above; the four migrated
providers' own pre-existing test files are unchanged in file and test
count, per the "proof external behavior didn't regress" note above).

**Coverage**: 100% statements / 100% branches / 100% functions / 100% lines,
package-wide (`pnpm --dir packages/media exec vitest run --coverage`),
including every new file (`vendor-adapter.ts`, `vendor-registry.ts`,
`response-parsers.ts`, `sqlite-task-store.ts`) and every refactored one
(`engine.ts`, `providers/openai.ts`, `providers/minimax.ts`,
`providers/senseaudio.ts`, `providers/fishaudio.ts`). `tsc --noEmit` and
`pnpm guard` both clean.

## 2026-07-21 addition (round 4) — the remaining 8 vendors migrated onto the generic dispatch engine (`feat/http-routes-and-cli-commands`)

Round 3 (above) built the generic `VendorAdapter`/`mediaVendorRegistry`
mechanism and migrated 4 vendors (`openai`, `minimax`, `senseaudio`,
`fishaudio`) onto it, leaving 8 still dispatched via `engine.ts`'s static
`ROUTES` table: `aihubmix`, `custom-image`, `elevenlabs`, `grok`,
`imagerouter`, `nanobanana`, `openrouter`, `volcengine`. This pass migrates
all 8 — every vendor `engine.ts` currently wires up now runs through
`mediaVendorRegistry`, and `ROUTES` is empty. Each vendor's own hand-written
`render*` function body was ported into a `buildRequest`/`parseResponse`
pair with **zero external-behavior change** — verified by running every
pre-existing per-vendor test file (`custom-image.test.ts`,
`imagerouter.test.ts`, `volcengine.test.ts`, `grok.test.ts`,
`nanobanana.test.ts`, `openrouter.test.ts`, `elevenlabs.test.ts`,
`aihubmix.test.ts`) and `engine.test.ts`'s existing per-vendor routing
tests **unmodified** against the refactored adapters (all pass), matching
round 3's own "proof external behavior didn't regress" convention. Landed
as 8 small commits, one per vendor, plus this doc update.

| Jini file | What changed | Response-parser reuse |
|---|---|---|
| `providers/custom-image.ts` | `renderCustomOpenAIImage` → one `VendorAdapter` (`'custom-image'`/`'image'`). Unlike every other vendor, `apiKey` is optional (a self-hosted gateway may need no auth), so there is no `requireCredential` guard — the two required-field checks (`baseUrl`, resolved `wireModel`) live at the top of `buildRequest`, which can still throw synchronously before any request is built. `customImageOverridesOpenAIModel`/`CUSTOM_IMAGE_MODEL_ID` are unchanged; `renderCustomOpenAIImage` stays a named export since `engine.ts`'s openai-image-override branch calls it directly, not through the registry. | Custom `parseResponse` reusing `openai-compatible.ts`'s `parseOpenAICompatibleJson`/`bytesFromOpenAICompatibleData` directly (its `{ data: [...] }` envelope isn't the "no envelope" shape either `response-parsers.ts` factory covers). |
| `providers/imagerouter.ts` | `renderImageRouterImage`/`renderImageRouterVideo` → two `VendorAdapter`s on the same `'imagerouter'` provider id (`'image'`/`'video'` routeKeys). | Same as `custom-image.ts` — bespoke `parseResponse` reusing the OpenAI-compatible JSON helpers directly. |
| `providers/volcengine.ts` | `renderVolcengineImage` → one `VendorAdapter` (`'volcengine'`/`'image'`). Both origin quirks (hardcoded `.png` suggestedExt, `openaiSizeFor` always resolving `1024x1024` for every Volcengine catalog id) preserved exactly, matching the module's existing doc comment. | Same OpenAI-compatible-JSON reuse as above. |
| `providers/grok.ts` | `renderGrokImage`/`renderXAITTS` → two `VendorAdapter`s on the same `'grok'` provider id (`'image'`/`'audio:speech'`). | Image: bespoke `parseResponse` via the OpenAI-compatible JSON helpers (same shape match the module doc already documented). TTS: raw bytes with no envelope — the same shape `fishaudio.ts`/`openai.ts`'s speech renderer return — now shares `response-parsers.ts`'s `createRawBytesParser` for the first time on this vendor. |
| `providers/nanobanana.ts` | `renderNanoBananaImage` → one `VendorAdapter` (`'nanobanana'`/`'image'`). | Bespoke `parseResponse` (Gemini `candidates[].content.parts[].inlineData.data` shape) — not shared with `aihubmix.ts`'s own Gemini branch below despite the structural similarity, because the two throw differently-tagged error messages on the same failure (verified by reading both), so forcing them through one factory would silently unify wording that was never unified in the origin. |
| `providers/openrouter.ts` | `renderOpenRouterImage` → one `VendorAdapter` (`'openrouter'`/`'image'`). | Bespoke `parseResponse` — the three-way image decode (`data:` URI / http(s) download / bare base64) against a chat-completions response shape has no other current consumer. |
| `providers/elevenlabs.ts` | `renderElevenLabsTTS`/`renderElevenLabsSfx` → two `VendorAdapter`s on the same `'elevenlabs'` provider id (`'audio:speech'`/`'audio:sfx'`). Both prompt-validation checks (non-empty; SFX ≤ 450 chars) now run inside `buildRequest`, which throws synchronously before any request is built — the "abort before the fetch" contract `dispatchVendorRequest` gives every adapter. | Both responses are raw bytes with no envelope, so both now share `createRawBytesParser` (first time this vendor's TTS/SFX pair has shared any plumbing with `fishaudio.ts`/`openai.ts`). |
| `providers/aihubmix.ts` | `renderAIHubMixImage`/`renderAIHubMixTTS` → two `VendorAdapter`s on the same `'aihubmix'` provider id (`'image'`/`'audio:speech'`). See the dedicated design note below — this is the one vendor in this batch where "port the logic into `buildRequest`/`parseResponse`" wasn't a mechanical relabeling. | TTS: `createRawBytesParser` (first time this vendor's TTS has shared plumbing with `fishaudio.ts`/`openai.ts`). Image: bespoke `parseResponse`, branching on a `meta.kind: 'gemini' \| 'openai'` tag set by `buildRequest`. |

**`aihubmix.ts`'s Gemini-vs-OpenAI branch — a real design decision, not a
mechanical port.** The origin (and the pre-migration Jini code) picks the
wire shape *before any network call* — `classifyAIHubMixModel(wireModel)`
is a pure string check, so `renderAIHubMixImage` branches into either the
OpenAI-compatible `/images/generations` path or a Gemini-native
`generateContent` path (via the now-superseded private
`renderAIHubMixGeminiImage` helper, which called `aihubmix-shared.ts`'s
`aihubmixGeminiImageBytes`) up front. `dispatchVendorRequest`'s harness is
`requireCredential -> buildRequest -> ONE fetch -> parseResponse`, so the
adapter has to make the same up-front decision inside `buildRequest`
itself (a pure function of `wireModel`, no I/O needed to decide) and
return the single correct request for whichever endpoint applies — never
build the OpenAI request when the model is a Gemini model, since AIHubMix
rejects that combination on its own side (`aihubmix-shared.ts`'s
`aihubmixGeminiImageBytes` doc comment: "Unknown name prompt/n/size").
`buildRequest` tags the choice in `meta.kind`; `parseResponse` branches on
it to decode the one response that comes back.

Deliberately **not** implemented by calling `aihubmixGeminiImageBytes` as
a black box from `parseResponse`: that helper bundles its own `fetch`
inside it (`doFetch`), so reusing it as-is would mean either a second,
wasted real network call (fetch the OpenAI endpoint, discard the response,
then really fetch the Gemini endpoint) or reimplementing the Gemini
URL/header/body construction a second time just to satisfy an unused
`doFetch` parameter — neither is a legitimate use of the harness's
"exactly one fetch" contract. Instead, `parseResponse`'s Gemini branch
replicates `aihubmixGeminiImageBytes`'s response-decoding logic directly
against the harness's already-fetched `Response` — same non-OK error
message (`aihubmix image (gemini) ${status}: ${text.slice(0, 240)}`,
including the `.catch(() => '')` fallback when reading the error body
itself fails), same `candidates[].content.parts[].inlineData.data` /
`inline_data.data` walk, same "no inline image data" error — verified
line-for-line against `aihubmix-shared.ts`, not paraphrased. That helper
(`aihubmixGeminiImageBytes`) stays exported and independently covered by
`aihubmix-shared.test.ts` (unchanged this pass); it's simply no longer
`aihubmix.ts`'s own call path. The "Simplified from the origin" dead-code
note the pre-migration file carried (the origin's
`renderAIHubMixGeminiImage` re-checking `credentials.apiKey` a second
time, provably unreachable from its one call site) no longer applies —
that private function doesn't exist as a separate call site anymore, its
logic is inlined directly into the adapter.

**Two coverage/staleness fixes needed by having migrated every
ROUTES-driven vendor in one pass**, not vendor-specific but caused by this
pass:
- `vendor-registry.test.ts`'s "does not have a not-yet-migrated vendor
  registered" test used `grok` as its negative example — now migrated, so
  repointed at `leonardo` (genuinely unwired — submit-then-poll shaped,
  deferred per the async-polling bucket above — matching
  `engine.test.ts`'s own stub-fallback fixture). Its "has every vendor
  migrated onto the generic engine registered" test was extended to assert
  all 12 now-migrated `(providerId, routeKey)` pairs, not just the original
  4.
- `engine.ts`'s `ROUTES`-table-fallback branch
  (`routes[providerId]?.[routeKey]`) became structurally unreachable
  through any current real vendor once `ROUTES` itself went empty — every
  wired vendor resolves via `mediaVendorRegistry` first. Rather than delete
  the fallback (a real, documented extensibility point for whichever
  vendor is wired up next without a registry adapter — e.g. one of the
  deferred async-polling vendors, if a future pass chooses a hand-written
  function over building a polling-aware adapter shape) or leave an
  untested branch, it was extracted into an exported, pure `lookupRoute(routes, providerId, routeKey)`
  function taking the routes table as a parameter instead of closing over
  the module-level constant — the same "extract to a directly-testable
  pure function" pattern `context.ts`'s `buildRenderContext` already
  established in round 1 for the identical reason (a real code path with
  no current way to observe it end-to-end). `engine.test.ts` gained a
  `describe('lookupRoute', ...)` block exercising all three branches
  (found; provider not found; provider found but routeKey not found)
  against a small locally-constructed table, independent of the
  (currently empty) production `ROUTES`.

**Tests**: `aihubmix.test.ts` grew by 6 (two Gemini-branch error paths —
non-OK response including the read-failure fallback, "no inline image
data" including a fully-absent-`candidates` case — plus the
`inline_data`/later-part decode branches, none of which the pre-migration
single-function implementation needed a *duplicated* test for since it
delegated that decoding to `aihubmixGeminiImageBytes`, whose own tests in
`aihubmix-shared.test.ts` covered it once; now that the decode logic is
inlined into `aihubmix.ts` itself, coverage tracks it as this file's own
lines). `engine.test.ts` grew by 3 (`lookupRoute`). `vendor-registry.test.ts`
was edited (not grown) — same 11 tests, extended assertions. No other
per-vendor test file was modified — all 8 pass unmodified against the
refactored adapters, proving the port is behavior-preserving.

**Coverage**: 100% statements / 100% branches / 100% functions / 100%
lines, package-wide (`pnpm --dir packages/media exec vitest run
--coverage`) — **572 tests across 32 files, up from 563/32** (same file
count as round 3 — this pass only edited existing files, no new ones).
`tsc --noEmit` and `pnpm guard` both clean.

## Not ported / explicitly out of scope (pre-existing, from the original pass)

- **`media/config.ts` in full** (23,414 bytes) — grepped for its exported
  function names and env-var table rather than read line-by-line. It resolves
  an OD-specific config file path (`OD_MEDIA_CONFIG_DIR`/`OD_DATA_DIR`-rooted
  `media-config.json`, `~/.open-design`-style paths) and per-project model
  aliasing (`resolveModelAlias`, consumed by `generateMedia` — the dispatch
  engine's `MediaGenerationRequest.wireModel` is the replacement, set by the
  caller instead of resolved from a project config file) — this is host/project configuration-file-format logic, not
  provider reference data, so none of it ported as code. Only the *env var
  names* (with `OD_*` overrides stripped) survive, as `providers.ts`'s
  `PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_ENV_VARS`.
- **`codex` provider + `codex-gpt-image-2` model** — dropped from
  `providers.ts`/`IMAGE_MODELS` (see the table row above): local Codex-CLI
  subscription auth, not a REST credential shape.
- **AMR/vela-specific integration wrapper** around
  `amr-image-staging.ts`'s actual staging logic — there wasn't one to find;
  see the `staging.ts` row above. The file's *name* implied vendor coupling
  that its *body* didn't have.

## Dependencies

`@jini/core` (workspace) for `token()` — see `src/tokens.ts`. `undici` (as of
the dispatch engine — `providers/openai.ts`'s long-timeout `Agent` for image
generation, mirroring `packages/deploy`'s use of the same package).
`better-sqlite3` + `@types/better-sqlite3` (as of the 2026-07-21 round-3
dispatch-engine-generalization pass — `src/sqlite-task-store.ts`'s durable
`MediaTaskStore` adapter; see that dated section above for why this
package, not `@jini/sqlite`, owns it).
`node:crypto` (`randomUUID`), `node:fs`/`node:path` (staging), and
`node:dns` (`ssrf-guard.ts`'s hostname-resolve check, added 2026-07-21
round 2) — Node built-ins. No `@open-design/contracts`.

## Coverage

`pnpm --filter @jini/media exec vitest run --coverage` (json-summary + json
reporters per `docs/jini-port/skills/fixing-open-design.md` Phase 6.5):
**100% statements / 100% branches / 100% functions / 100% lines**, aggregate
and per file, across the whole package including the dispatch engine added
this pass (280 tests across 17 files; the dispatch-engine tests mock a real
`fetch`/`Response` rather than the provider functions themselves, so the
actual URL-building/body-shaping/response-parsing logic is exercised
end-to-end, not bypassed). Enforced by a real `thresholds: { statements:
100, branches: 100, functions: 100, lines: 100 }` gate in
`vitest.config.ts`, not just measured. `src/dispatch/types.ts` is excluded
from the coverage config for the same reason as the top-level `src/types.ts`
(a genuinely zero-executable-statement file — verified via `grep`, not a
coverage dodge).

Reaching 100% (up from an initial ~89% branches on the dispatch engine)
involved one genuine dead-code removal and one refactor, not contrived
tests written just to hit a line — matching this repo's own
coverage-driven-refactor convention, and specifically avoiding trading real
capability for a coverage number:
- **One dead branch removed**: a `findProvider(def.provider)` null-check in
  the stub-fallback path (every catalogued model's `provider` id is proven
  present in `MEDIA_PROVIDERS` by a new `providers.test.ts`
  catalogue-integrity test added this pass). `clampNumber`'s
  `allowed.length === 0` guard was removed the same way (unreachable — its
  only two call sites always pass `providers.ts`'s non-empty
  `VIDEO_LENGTHS_SEC`/`AUDIO_DURATIONS_SEC` constants, proven by an existing
  `providers.test.ts` test) — both are internal defensive guards with no
  user-visible capability attached, not a scope question.
- **One extraction, not a removal**: `promptInfluence` and `imageRefs`
  (plural) are real origin fields (`renderElevenLabsSfx`'s prompt-influence
  dial; multi-image i2v/style-reference flows) not consumed by any renderer
  ported in this pass. The first attempt at 100% dropped both from the
  type surface as "unobservable" — correctly flagged by the user as a real
  capability reduction disguised as a coverage fix, not acceptable just
  because nothing currently reads them. The actual fix: pull `ctx`
  construction out of `engine.ts` into its own pure, exported
  `context.ts`/`buildRenderContext` function, so both fields' derivation
  (including their edge cases — a non-finite `promptInfluence`, an explicit
  `imageRefs` array vs one derived from a single `imageRef`) can be tested
  directly against the function's return value instead of needing a live
  renderer to observe them through. Both fields are back in
  `MediaGenerationRequest`/`RenderContext`, genuinely tested
  (`context.test.ts`), with zero capability lost relative to the origin.
- Everything else was genuinely reachable and got a real test: Azure
  error-tagging paths, dall-e-2 vs dall-e-3 quality branches, every
  aspect-ratio size-mapping branch, unparseable-URL fallback paths in the
  URL builders, and the stub renderer's `?? '?'`/`|| '-'` note-formatting
  fallbacks.

### Original substrate coverage note (pre-dispatch-engine)

No `/* v8 ignore */` or equivalent suppression comment anywhere in this
package. One dead branch found during the coverage loop (`providers.ts`'s
`modelsForSurface` — see its row above) was refactored away rather than
tested around; every other uncovered line found during the loop (an fs
`readdir`/`stat` best-effort catch, a stray-non-file directory entry in the
staging dir, an unparseable `supportedSizes` entry) was genuinely reachable
and got a real test, several using `vi.spyOn` to force the underlying
`fs.promises` call to fail for real rather than being skipped.
