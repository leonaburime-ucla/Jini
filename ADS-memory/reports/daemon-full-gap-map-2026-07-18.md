# OD daemon → Jini: full gap map + port plan (2026-07-18)

**Purpose:** the user wants the *full functionality* of OD's daemon in Jini, not the
current thin kernel slice. This maps every top-level module of OD `apps/daemon/src`
(~174K non-test lines) against what actually exists in `@jini/*`, classifies each as
engine-generic vs OD-product, and gives a dependency-ordered build order to a
**runnable full daemon**. Approve/adjust the scope and order before any porting.

## How the presence column was established

Not asserted — measured. Five adversarial auditors verified the backend packages this
session against the real OD clone at `/Users/la/Desktop/Programming/OSS-Repos/open-design`.
Every "✅ ported" / "⚠️ partial" row below is backed by a diff- or test-level check
(daemon, cli, sqlite, node-host, http, protocol, core, sidecar, platform, agent-runtime).
Packages marked "(unaudited)" have a `@jini/*` counterpart that was NOT checked this
session (memory, registry, deploy, media) — treat their state as claimed, not verified.

Legend: ✅ ported & verified · ⚠️ partial · ❌ absent · 🟩 engine-generic · 🟦 OD-product · 🟨 mixed/triage

## C. The verdict in one line

**Engine-generic execution *primitives* are substantially ported and well-tested
(agent-runtime, http, core, platform, sidecar, artifacts, migration). The *service
spine* that makes it a runnable daemon — `server.ts`, `cli.ts` bootstrap, `db.ts`
schema, `routes/`, `mcp.ts`, and the `start-chat-run.ts` run orchestration — is
absent. Product modules (~60K lines: brands, design-systems, connectors, critique,
figma, genui, langfuse, …) are absent by design and stay out of the neutral engine.**

## D. Dependency-ordered build plan → runnable full generic daemon

Product 🟦 modules are excluded (they belong in a consumer/adapter like
`integrations/open-design`, per the repo's neutrality boundary). Each phase is
checkpointed: commit + push after each unit, not just at phase end.

- **Phase 0 — Triage + assembly spine (prove it boots).**
  Resolve 🟨 generic-vs-product for `plugins/`, `live-artifacts/`, `routes/`,
  `browser/`, `byok-tools`, `lint-artifact`. Then build `createLocalNodeDaemon` in
  `@jini/node-host`: port the *generic spine* of `server.ts` (app + middleware +
  `.listen()`) and `cli.ts` `daemon start`, wiring `@jini/core` DI + `@jini/sqlite`
  + `@jini/http` (actually call `express()`/`listen`) + `@jini/agent-runtime`.
  **Exit:** `jini daemon start` boots and serves `/status`.
- **Phase 1 — Persistence.** Port the generic `db.ts` schema (runs, conversations,
  messages, artifacts, events) into `@jini/sqlite`; make `EventLog` durable.
- **Phase 2 — Run orchestration.** Generalize `start-chat-run.ts` (3,715 ln) into
  `@jini/daemon`: the loop that accepts a run, drives `@jini/agent-runtime`, streams
  events to `EventLog`, applies close-status. **This is the keystone** — it connects
  the ported primitives into actual execution.
- **Phase 3 — Service surface.** Port the generic `routes/` subset (run
  create/list/get/stream/cancel, artifacts, health, version) into `@jini/http`,
  mounted by the Phase-0 spine.
- **Phase 4 — MCP host.** Port `mcp.ts` + `mcp-config` + `mcp-routes` into a new
  `@jini/mcp` (or into agent-runtime) so the daemon serves MCP.
- **Phase 5 — Plugin host.** Port the generic `plugins/` host into
  `@jini/plugin-runtime` (OD `packages/plugin-runtime` is the model).
- **Phase 6 — Capability completion.** Finish `@jini/media` dispatch, `@jini/memory`,
  `@jini/registry`, `@jini/deploy` to real wired functionality (audit each first —
  they were not verified this session).

**Rough generic-engine scope still to port:** server/cli-bootstrap ~12K · db schema
~2K · run orchestration ~4K · generic routes ~6-8K · mcp host ~4K · plugin host ~8-10K
· capability completion ~10K ≈ **45-50K lines of real work** (vs ~60K of product
modules intentionally excluded).

## PART 2 — Everything beyond the daemon (the rest of the full picture)

The daemon is only ~28% of OD (~174K of ~615K lines). This session audited ONLY the
daemon-backed packages. Everything below is either mapped-by-size-but-unaudited or
not mapped at all. Status: ✅ audited this session · ⚠️ Jini counterpart exists, NOT
verified · ❓ no correspondence established · ⬜ out of scope.

### H. The headline outside the daemon

**The frontend is the daemon problem again, bigger and still open.** OD ships
**160,894 lines of UI components**; Jini's `ui` is 30K claiming to be the neutral
extraction — and not one line of it has been verified this session. Same unanswered
question as the daemon ("faithful extraction, or thin/padded?"), on a 2× surface.
Second: OD `packages/contracts` is 18K of DTOs and only ~432 lines surfaced in
`@jini/protocol` — the rest is unmapped. Backend audit = 5 of 22 packages' worth of
trust; **17 packages (~46.5K lines) remain unverified.**

## PART 3 — `@jini/ui` audit result (2026-07-18, inline via graph + direct reads)

Method: OD component sizes measured directly (`wc -l`, the graph's `lines` field is
unpopulated); OD ground-truth located via codebase-memory-mcp; Jini slices read
directly; package-wide hollow-test scan. Sampled 2 of 21 vertical slices deeply
(connectors, memory) + full-package structural/test scan. NOT every slice deep-diffed.

**Coverage delta — DEFENSIBLE.** ~30K of generic widgets extracted from OD's ~160K
`apps/web/src/components`. OD's largest components are skipped, correctly, because
they're product-specific: `FileViewer.tsx` (14,495), `ProjectView.tsx` (10,058),
`DesignSystemFlow` (5,481), `HomeHero` (5,026), design/brand/pet/plugins-home. The
port targets reusable widgets (connectors, memory, settings-dialog shell, sketch
editor, asset grid/tree, viewer shell), often as ~25% slices of larger OD files.
`chat`/composer components (~14K) belong to `chat-react`/`renderers-react` (separate,
still unaudited).

**Fidelity (sampled) — REAL, not padded.** `features/connectors` (2,311) and
`features/memory` (4,452) are genuine decompositions of OD monoliths into
component/hook/rule/port modules with a dependency-injection test seam, i18n, and a
paired test per source file. Jini-bigger-than-OD is explained by decomposition +
tests + extracted ports, not padding. Package-wide: 255 test files, 4,743 `expect()`,
2,568 cases, **zero** `expect(true)`, **zero** `.skip/.todo/.only`, zero OD identity
strings in sampled slices. `ConnectorsBrowser.tsx` is substantive component logic with
a provenance doc-comment, not a stub.

**Verdict: SOLID-PORT (sampled).** Consistent with the backend pattern — real,
de-branded, heavily-tested extractions. Residual risk: 19 of 21 slices not
deep-diffed, and `chat-react`/`chat-core`/`renderers-react`/`desktop-host` + the
new-addition packages remain unaudited.

## PART 4 — Bottom line across everything audited

Audited this session: **10 backend packages + agent-runtime + `ui` (sampled)**. Every
one came back a real, faithful, de-branded, tested port — several to an "exemplary"
standard under adversarial diffing. **The "cheated / ported almost nothing" thesis does
not hold.** The accurate finding is different and more useful:

1. **What exists is genuine and high-quality** — not fabricated, not hollow-tested.
2. **Scope is a deliberate, honestly-documented slice** — the generic/reusable parts;
   product code is skipped by design (neutral-engine constraint).
3. **The real gap is ASSEMBLY, not authenticity.** No runnable daemon (backend service
   spine — `server.ts`/`cli.ts` bootstrap/`routes`/`mcp.ts`/`start-chat-run` — absent),
   and the `ui` widgets aren't assembled into a running app either. You have excellent
   *parts*, not yet a *product*.
4. **Minor doc overstatements exist** (home-expansion "verbatim", a stale http "stub"
   note, codex.ts under-itemized) — real but behavior-neutral, not the systemic
   fabrication that was feared.

Still unverified: `chat-react`, `chat-core`, `renderers-react`, `desktop-host`,
`deploy`, `media`, `memory`, `registry`, `diagnostics`, `metatool`, and greenfield
`capability-providers` (~15K lines).

## E. Open scope question for the user

"All the daemon functionality" has two readings: **(1) full generic runnable daemon**
(this plan — strip product 🟦), or **(2) everything incl. product** (brands,
design-systems, connectors, critique — breaks the neutral-engine architecture the repo
enforces). This plan assumes (1). If (2), the product modules get appended as consumer
adapters, not folded into `@jini/*`.
